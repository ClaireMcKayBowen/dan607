How and when to use other communication platforms?\n\n\n### Collaboration skills generally\n\n### Interpersonal skills\n\n### How to network\n\n### How to take initiative in decision-making and leadership\n\n### How to get feedback\n\n## Difficult conversations\n\n### How can you raise a concern about a certain subject?\n<!-- Answer: Choose an appropriate time and place for the conversation. Be clear and specific about your concern, focusing on the issue rather than the person. Use \"I\" statements to express how the situation affects you, and propose a constructive solution. Be open to feedback and willing to listen to the other person's perspective. -->\n\n### How can you properly disagree appropriately?\n\n  <!-- Answer: Respectfully state your differing opinion using calm and non-confrontational language. Provide reasons and evidence to support your viewpoint. Acknowledge the other person's perspective and look for common ground. Aim for a constructive discussion rather than a debate or argument. -->\n\n### How can you send follow-up emails on time-sensitive items without sounding annoyed or aggressive?\n\n<!-- Answer: Use a polite and professional tone, and start with a friendly greeting. Clearly state the purpose of your follow-up and reference the previous communication. Express understanding if there have been delays and reiterate the importance or urgency of the matter. Offer assistance if needed and thank the recipient for their attention to the issue. -->\n\n## Other communication\n\n### How can you leave an appropriate voicemail (e.g., setting up your answering machine)?\n\n<!-- Answer: Keep your voicemail greeting concise and professional, stating your name, your availability, and an invitation to leave a message. When leaving a voicemail, speak clearly and provide your name, the purpose of your call, and your contact information. Keep the message brief and to the point, and mention any relevant deadlines. -->\n\n### What are some tips for proper over-the-phone etiquette?\n\n<!-- Answer: Answer the phone with a polite greeting, including your name and company if applicable. Speak clearly and at a moderate pace. Listen attentively and avoid interrupting the other person. Use a friendly and respectful tone, and avoid multitasking during the call. End the call with a courteous closing, such as \"Thank you for your time.\" -->\n\n### How should you handle greetings and titles in written and verbal communication, such as when someone has a PhD?\n\n<!-- Answer: In formal communication, use titles and last names (e.g., Dr. Smith) until invited to use the person's first name. In written communication, start with a formal greeting (e.g., \"Dear Dr. Smith\") and use the appropriate title throughout the message. In verbal communication, address the person by their title unless they ask you to do otherwise. When in doubt, err on the side of formality to show respect. -->\n\n\n\n",
