Depending on the source, primary data may include some paradata.[^paradata]\n\n[^paradata]: Paradata are a by-product of data collection. Types of paradata vary from contact attempt history records for interviewer-assisted operations, to form tracing using tracking numbers in mail surveys, to keystroke or mouse-click history for internet self-response surveys. Because paradata are a by-product of a given data collection operation, their format, layout, and content are a function of the system that generated the data.\n\n### Secondary data\nSecondary data also include both quantitative and qualitative data; these may also include some paradata. Often, secondary data are in public-use files that have been sanitized for general release and use (e.g., public file of the American Community Survey).\n\n### Administrative data\nAdministrative data are collected for the administration of an organization or program by entities, such as government agencies as they provide services, companies to track orders, and universities to record registered students. These data records are usually not public-use data files and tend to only be accessed through strict confidentiality agreements, such as non-disclosure agreements or memorandum of understanding (e.g., IRS tax payer data).\n\n::: callout\n#### [Class Activity 1]{style=\"color:#1696d2;\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nFor each data type:\n\n - What are some other examples?\n - Using those examples, what are the possible security, privacy, ethical, and equity considerations and challenges?\n - If these challenges are not addressed, what are the potential downstream impact?\n \n:::\n\n## Discussion on Do No Harm Guide: Collecting, Analyzing, and Reporting Gender and Sexual Orientation Data\n\n> If [equity] isn’t considered in the design of the study for that small subgroup, then it’s not the main purpose of the study. Other parts will take priority. Afterall, what was the study designed for? - Saki Kinney, RTI (Research Triangle International)\n\nThis quote from a colleague highlights the importance of how data is collected. If we blindly collect data without careful consideration of the process—such as how we define groups or the methods used for data collection—we could severely and negatively impact those groups when others in the data ecosystem use and analyze that data.\n\nWe will use the required reading assignment to facilitate the discussion on the potential security, privacy, ethical, and equity challenges in data collection.\n\n::: callout\n#### [Class Activity 2]{style=\"color:#1696d2;\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nThere is a glossary at the start of the Do No Harm Guide (DNHG) instead of at the end. Why do you think the authors had the glossary so early in the report?\n\nDo think the government, schools, or other organizations that collect data use the same definition when collecting data? What is the impact of not having a standard definition for each stakeholder in the data ecosystem?\n \n:::\n\n## If there is no data, there is no problem\n\n[@d2023data]\n\n## Week 3 Assignment\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## DEADLINE\nDue June 6, at 11:59 PM EDT on Canvas\n::: \n\n### Read\n\n- Chapter 3: How Do Data Privacy Methods Expand Access to Data?\n\n### Optional additional read\n\n[Do No Harm Guide: Applying Equity Awareness in Data Privacy Methods](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/do-no-harm-guide-applying-equity-awareness-data-privacy-methods).\n\n### Write (600 to 1200 words)\n\nWe learned that one way to define data equity in the context of privacy is to consider equal privacy loss or equal access for different subgroups. Answer the following questions:\n\n- Do you agree that these are helpful ways to define equity in the context of privacy?\n- Are there additional ways you would define equity in the context of privacy?\n- Are there other equity considerations to take into account?\n- What are the ethical implications of defining equity in the context of privacy in these ways?",
