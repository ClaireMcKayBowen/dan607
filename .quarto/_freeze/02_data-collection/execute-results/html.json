Types of paradata vary from contact attempt history records for interviewer-assisted operations, to form tracing using tracking numbers in mail surveys, to keystroke or mouse-click history for internet self-response surveys. Because paradata are a by-product of a given data collection operation, their format, layout, and content are a function of the system that generated the data.\n\n### Administrative data\nAdministrative data records are usually not public-use data files and tend to only be accessed through strict confidentiality agreements, such as non-disclosure agreements or memorandum of understanding.\n\n::: callout\n#### [Class Activity 1]{style=\"color:#1696d2;\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWhat are examples of each kind of data?\n\n:::\n\n## Discussion on DNHG: SOGI Questions\n\nIf SOGI or other questions are not part of the data collection design, then what is the point?\n\n## Week 3 Assignment\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## DEADLINE\nDue June 6, at 11:59 PM EDT on Canvas\n::: \n\n### Read\n\n- Chapter 3: How Do Data Privacy Methods Expand Access to Data?\n\n### Optional additional read\n\n[Do No Harm Guide: Applying Equity Awareness in Data Privacy Methods](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/do-no-harm-guide-applying-equity-awareness-data-privacy-methods).\n\n### Write (600 to 1200 words)\n\nWe learned that one way to define data equity in the context of privacy is to consider equal privacy loss or equal access for different subgroups. Answer the following questions:\n\n- Do you agree that these are helpful ways to define equity in the context of privacy?\n- Are there additional ways you would define equity in the context of privacy?\n- Are there other equity considerations to take into account?\n- What are the ethical implications of defining equity in the context of privacy in these ways?",
