Also, with primary you will usually have access to paradata.[^paradata]\n\n[^paradata]: Paradata are a by-product of data collection. Types of paradata vary from contact attempt history records for interviewer-assisted operations, to form tracing using tracking numbers in mail surveys, to keystroke or mouse-click history for internet self-response surveys. Because paradata are a by-product of a given data collection operation, their format, layout, and content are a function of the system that generated the data.\n\n### Secondary data\nSecondary data also include both quantitative and qualitative data; depending on the source, they may also include some paradata. Often, secondary data are in public-use files that have been sanitized for general release and use (e.g., public file of the American Community Survey[^ACS]).\n\n[^ACS]: \"The American Community Survey (ACS) helps local officials, community leaders, and businesses understand the changes taking place in their communities. It is the premier source for detailed population and housing information about our nation.\" Quoted from the U.S. Census Bureau website found [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs).\n\n### Administrative data\nAdministrative data are collected for the administration of an organization or program by entities, such as government agencies as they provide services, companies to track orders, and universities to record registered students. These data records are usually not public-use data files and tend to only be accessed through strict confidentiality agreements, such as non-disclosure agreements or memorandum of understanding (e.g., IRS tax payer data).\n\n::: callout\n#### [Class Activity 1]{style=\"color:#1696d2;\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nFor each data type:\n\n - What are some other examples?\n - What are the possible security, privacy, ethical, and equity considerations and challenges?\n - If these challenges are not addressed, what are the potential downstream impact?\n \n:::\n\n## Discussion on Do No Harm Guide: Collecting, Analyzing, and Reporting Gender and Sexual Orientation Data\n\n> If equity isn’t considered in the design of the study for that small subgroup, then it’s not the main purpose of the study. Other parts will take priority. Afterall, what was the study designed for?\n\n~ Saki Kinney, RTI (Research Triangle International)\n\nThis quote from a colleague highlights the importance of how data is collected. If we blindly collect data without careful consideration of the process—such as how we define groups or the methods used for data collection—we could severely and negatively impact those groups when others in the data ecosystem use and analyze that data.\n\nThe required reading assignment, Do No Harm Guide (DNHG) by @schwabish2023no, covers many data collection challenges and will facilitate our discussion on the potential security, privacy, ethical, and equity issues in data collection.\n\n![The cover of the Urban Institute report, \"Do No Harm Guide: Collecting, Analyzing, and Reporting Gender and Sexual Orientation Data .\"](www/images/dnhg-sogi.png){#fig-dnhg-sogi fig-align=\"center\" width=60%}\n\n### Defining groups is important\n\n> Collecting data about sexual orientation and gender identity and expression allows for a better understanding of sexual and gender minority populations, enabling researchers, policymakers, and advocates to understand differences between these populations and other population groups or the general population across policy areas. Insight from these data highlight important areas for interventions that may improve the lives of members of sexual and gender minority groups.\n\n::: callout\n#### [Class Activity 2]{style=\"color:#1696d2;\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nThere is a glossary at the start of the DNHG instead of at the end.\n\n- Why do you think the authors had the glossary so early in the report?\n- Do you think the government, schools, or other organizations that collect data use the same definition when collecting data?\n- What is the impact of not having a standard definition for each stakeholder in the data ecosystem?\n \n:::\n\n### Trans-parency in the legal community\n\nThe American Bar Association wants to release more demographic information about students who attend law school and complete the bar exam. One piece of information they want to share is the number of transgender students attending their law schools. Some students support this decision, believing it will allow other transgender students to reach out to them or see that the law school is welcoming toward transgender students. Others, however, want this information to be withheld for safety reasons, preferring that their law programs do not disclose that they have transgender students.\n\n::: callout\n#### [Class Activity 3]{style=\"color:#1696d2;\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nIn this scenario, how would you answer the following:\n\n- User engagement is emphasized in the DNHG. Who would you try to engage in a conversation about collecting and releasing information about transgender students in law school?\n- What are your thoughts if the decision is to collect the data, but the outcome is not to release the information?\n- What are the security, privacy, ethics, and equity considerations when deciding to collect and/or release the information?\n\n:::\n\nInstitutional Review Boards (IRBs) review an institution's (e.g., university, government agency) research, evaluation, and technical assistance projects involving information collected from or about human subjects. The IRB reviews projects’ data collection procedures and data security plans with the objective of protecting the rights and welfare of human subjects and minimizing risks to them, as mandated by federal regulations and consistent with longstanding institutional policies.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## The importance of IRB\nAny university or research institution-led survey or data collection involving human subjects must undergo an Institutional Review Board (IRB) process. If you see someone conducting a survey without information about the security, privacy, and confidentiality of the data, including its use, storage, and termination, you must report it to the university's or research institution's IRB.\n::: \n\n### How do we define ourselves and society\n\n> There are two sides to survey data collection: the experience of the participant and the experience of the researcher. Thus, building trust between the participant and the researcher is key to generating high-quality data. Communicating to people why their personal information is necessary and gaining their formal consent can lead to greater collaboration and, ultimately, allow for more inclusive survey methods.\n\nPart 3 of the DNHG reviews various methods for conducting surveys to collect sexual orientation and gender identity information. This highlights the challenge of properly defining groups in a way that is both consistent and inclusive.\n\n::: callout\n#### [Class Activity 4]{style=\"color:#1696d2;\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nArticle I, Section 2 of the Constitution mandates that a census must take place every 10 years in the United States. The data collected by the decennial census determine the number of seats each state has in the U.S. House of Representatives and how to distribute the trillions in federal funds to local communities.\n\nAs part of the decennial census, people must answer several questions, such as what is their race. How would define your race?\n\nThe images below show the race question for the 1990 and 2020 Census questionnaire. Would your definition match what is offered in these questionnaires?\n:::\n\n![1990 Census Race Question](www/images/1990-census-race-question.png){#fig-1990-census-race fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![2020 Census Race Question](www/images/rsblog-race-hispanic-origin-figure-2.jpg){#fig-2020-census-race fig-align=\"center\" width=80%}\n\nThe nuances of different races is important in some contexts and not in others. For example, the state of Wyoming probably only needs to know the number of Asian Americans (i.e., coarsen all subgroups into the larger group), whereas New York City needs the count of various subgroups, because each subgroup has different poverty rates [@sonoda2023].\n\n## No data, no problem, no action\n\nWe will cover two real-world example sets where the lack of data or improper data collection negatively impacts downstream data analysis.\n\n### Library of Missing Datasets\n\nDo you agree or disagree that we should answer the following questions with data?\n\n- Sales and prices in the art world (and relationships between artists and gallerists)\n- People excluded from public housing because of criminal records\n- Trans people killed or injured in instances of hate crime (note: existing records are notably unreliable or incomplete)\n- Poverty and employment statistics that include people who are behind bars\n- Muslim mosques/communities surveilled by the FBI/CIA\n- Mobility for older adults with physical disabilities or cognitive impairments\n- LGBT older adults discriminated against in housing\n- Undocumented immigrants currently incarcerated and/or underpaid\n- Undocumented immigrants for whom prosecutorial discretion has been used to justify release or general punishment\n- Measurements for global web users that take into account shared devices and VPNs\n- Firm statistics on how often police arrest women for making false rape reports\n- Master database that details if/which Americans are registered to vote in multiple states\n- Total number of local and state police departments using stingray phone trackers (IMSI-catchers)\n- How much Spotify pays each of its artists per play of song\n\nWhat if you were then told that there are no such datasets created or available to answer these questions?\n\n![The image from Mimi Ọnụọha's The Library of Missing Datasets 3.0](www/images/mo_the-library-of-missing-datasetss-v-3.0_01_rt.jpg){#fig-1990-census-race fig-align=\"center\" width=50%}\n\nThese questions are part of a mixed-media installation by [Mimi Ọnụọha](https://mimionuoha.com/) called, The Library of Missing Datasets, which is on [version 3.0](https://mimionuoha.com/the-library-of-missing-datasets-v3). This piece is a physical repository of those things that have been excluded in a society where so much is collected.\n\nFrom Mimi Onuoha's website,\n\n> \"Missing datasets\" are the blank spots that exist in spaces that are otherwise data-saturated. Wherever large amounts of data are collected, there are often empty spaces where no data live. The word \"missing\" is inherently normative. It implies both a lack and an ought: something does not exist, but it should. That which should be somewhere is not in its expected place; an established system is disrupted by distinct absence. That which we ignore reveals more than what we give our attention to. It’s in these things that we find cultural and colloquial hints of what is deemed important. Spots that we've left blank reveal our hidden social biases and indifferences.\n\n::: callout\n#### [Class Activity 5]{style=\"color:#1696d2;\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nMimi Ọnụọha created the list of questions for \"The Library of Missing Datasets 3.0\" in 2022. Her GitHub repo indicates that one of the illustrative examples from her version 2 installation in 2018 is no longer missing.\n\n> Civilians killed in encounters with police or law enforcement agencies [update: this is no longer a missing dataset]\n\nIn the next 10 to 15 minutes, pick one of the example questions from the \"Library of Missing Datasets 3.0\" and try to find a *publicly available dataset* that answers that question.\n\nDid you find a dataset that works? If not, did you find a dataset that was close? Why did the dataset not answer the question?\n\n:::\n\nMimi Ọnụọha says there are many reasons why some potentially important datasets are missing and highlights four reasons:\n\n1. Those who have the resources to collect data lack the incentive to (corollary: often those who have access to a dataset are the same ones who have the ability to remove, hide, or obscure it).\n\n> Police brutality towards civilians provides a powerful example. Though policing and crime are among the most data-driven areas of public policy, traditionally there has been little history of standardized and rigorous data collected about police brutality. Nowadays we have a political and cultural climate where this issue has become one of public discussion. Public interest campaigns like Fatal Encounters and the Guardian’s The Counted have helped fill that void. But even for these individuals/organizations, the work is difficult and time-consuming. The group who would make the most sense to monitor this issue—the law enforcement agents who create the data set in the first place—have no incentive to actually gather such data, which could prove incriminating.\n\n2. The data to be collected resist simple quantification (corollary: we prioritize collecting things that fit our modes of collection).\n\n> The defining tension of data collection is the struggle of taking a messy, organic world and defining it in formats that are neat, clean, and structured. Some things are difficult to collect and quantify by nature of their structure. We don't know how much US currency is outside of our borders. There's no incentive for other countries to monitor US currency within their countries, and the very nature of cash and the anonymity it affords makes it difficult to track. But then there are other subjects that resist quantification entirely. Things like emotions are hard to quantify (at this time, at least). Institutional racism is subtle and deniable; it reveals itself more in effects than acts. Not all things are easily quantifiable, and at times the very desire to render the world more abstract, trackable, and machine-readable is an idea that itself deserves questioning.\n\n3. The act of collection involves more work than the benefit the presence of the data is perceived to give.\n\n> Sexual assault and harassment are woefully underreported. And while there are many reasons why this is, one major one is that in many cases the very act of reporting sexual assault is a very intensive, painful, and difficult process. For some, the benefit of reporting isn't perceived to be equal or greater than the cost of the process.\n\n4. There are advantages to nonexistence.\n\n> Every missing dataset is a testament to this fact. Just as the presence of data benefits someone, so too does the absence. This is important to keep in mind. However, there's an even more specific angle to this point. To collect, record, and archive aspects of the world is an intentional act, one that typically benefits those who have the power to decide what should be collected. Often, remaining outside of the bounds of collection can be a form of response for a situationally-disadvantaged group. In short, sometimes a missing dataset can function as a form of protection.\n\n::: callout\n#### [Class Activity 6]{style=\"color:#1696d2;\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nIf you could not find a dataset, why do you think that dataset doesn't exist based on the four reasons Mimi Ọnụọha highlighted?\n \n:::\n\n### Asian Americans are highly educated, born in the U.S., and speak English\n\nNot collecting data is one issue. Another, which could be just as or even more detrimental to society, is collecting the wrong kind of data. If we are not careful with how we design data collection, we could create harmful narratives about certain areas of society, especially underrepresented groups.\n\nAn example of this is work done by my colleague, [Dr. Sunghee Lee](https://surveydatascience.isr.umich.edu/slee) of the University of Michigan. She presented her in the same conference session as me, where she discussed how incomplete data on Asian-American populations risks fueling a vicious circle of inaction and growing inequality. One of her projects compared the socio-demographics of Asian-American respondents reported in four large-scale sample surveys against the same characteristics collected by the US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey,[^ACS] which is often referred to as the gold standard survey on the United States populations and housing information [@tarran2023].\n\n[^ACS]: \"The American Community Survey helps local officials, community leaders, and businesses understand the changes taking place in their communities. It is the premier source for detailed population and housing information about our nation.\" [U.S. Census Bureau's page on the American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs).\n\nWhen comparing these surveys, Dr. Lee found that the four surveys often differed in important respects. For example, Asian Americans accounted for seven percent of adults aged 18 and over in the American Community Survey. In contrast, the General Social Survey[^GSS] and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey[^BRFSS] accounted for only four percent and two percent, respectively. The American Community Survey shows 27 percent of Asian-American respondents are educated to high-school level or below, the equivalent grouping in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey accounted for 18 percent.\n\n[^GSS]: \"[C]onducted every two years, NORC interviews a representative sample of Americans about a range of topics. The questions address belief in God, confidence in government institutions, race relations, abortion, spending patterns, gun rights, social isolation—even pet ownership.\" [NORC at the University of Chicago's page on the General Social Survey](https://www.norc.org/research/projects/gss.html).\n\n[^BRFSS]: \"The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nation’s premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.\" [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's page on the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html). \n\nHowever, none of these surveys, except the American Community Survey, collected data on Asian Americans’ proficiency with spoken English.\n\nAccording to the American Community Survey, 31 percent of Asian-American adults have \"limited English proficiency.\" Dr. Lee's research found that none of the four selected surveys (General Social Survey and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, plus the Current Population Survey[^CPS] and National Health Interview Survey[^NHIS]) offered questionnaires in Asian languages; only English and Spanish.\n\n[^CPS]: \"The Current Population Survey, sponsored jointly by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, is the primary source of labor force statistics for the population of the United States.\" [U.S. Census Bureau's page on the Current Population Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html).\n\n[^NHIS]: \"The National Health Interview Survey on a broad range of health topics are collected through personal household interviews. Survey results have been instrumental in providing data to track health status, health care access, and progress toward achieving national health objectives.\" [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's page on the National Health Interview Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.htm). \n\nDue to the poorly designed surveys, anyone using these data will find that most Asian Americans are born in the US and/or who have high levels of English proficiency, missing the true geographic and ethnic heterogeneity of the Asian American population. This underrepresentation of certain Asian-American subgroups encourages a potential vicious cycle of having no \"data-driven\" proof to collect such information. This means that issues affecting certain population groups are not identified, meaning no action needs to be taken.\n\nHence, at the end of the presentation, Dr. Lee's slide stated, \"No data, no problem, no action\".\n\n![Roll Safe Think About It meme that says, \"Can't have any issues, if there is no data.\"](www/images/no-data.jpg){#fig-no-data fig-align=\"center\" width=80%}\n\n::: callout\n#### [Class Activity 7]{style=\"color:#1696d2;\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\nAfter learning about this use case, answer the following:\n\n- What is your reaction to this situation?\n- Can you think of other situations where a lack of data would lead to no action because no one knows there is a problem?\n\n:::\n\n## Week 3 Assignment\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## DEADLINE\nDue June 6, at 11:59 PM EDT on Canvas\n::: \n\n### Read\n\n- Chapter 3: How Do Data Privacy Methods Expand Access to Data?\n\n### Optional additional read\n\n- [Do No Harm Guide: Applying Equity Awareness in Data Privacy Methods](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/do-no-harm-guide-applying-equity-awareness-data-privacy-methods).\n\n### Write (600 to 1200 words)\n\nWe learned that one way to define data equity in the context of privacy is to consider equal privacy loss or equal access for different subgroups.
