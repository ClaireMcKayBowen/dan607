Throughout the course, we will explore the significance, historical context, current methodologies, privacy legislation, and forthcoming developments in this field.\n\nThe course is predominantly conceptual, recognizing that students will possess varying levels of analytical skills. I expect students to be actively engaged in discussions, which is why \"Community Contributions\" accounts for 25% of your grade. Another 25% is your writing assignments. Please take your writing assignments seriously. While I will not grade based on writing quality (this is not an English course), I do expect minimal typos, grammar, and mechanics errors. The purpose of the writing assignments is for you to reflect on the content you have learned and see how it applies to the real world, your potential professional work, community, and personal life.\n\nThe final will be a presentation. We will discuss further details about the presentation during our week 4 class on June 14th. The main reason I have chosen a presentation for your final is that verbal communication is crucial in most professions and is often not taught in courses. Part of our week 4 class will involve learning how to create better presentations and how to present more technical content to a broader audience.\n\n## Developing your professional skills\n\nIn line with learning more professional non-technical skills (like week 4 class on presentations), each class will cover a professional topic, such as effective communication, in addition to learning about data security, privacy, ethics, and equity. The purpose of this is to provide additional information that is often not taught in courses, helping to prepare you for the professional environment.\n\n## Assignments\n\nThe first assignment starts on day one (May 20) but is not due until the day before we first meet (May 30, at 11:59 PM EDT). Since all the assignments are listed out, you may choose to get a head start on them, but I advise pacing yourself with the class, as you will want the content you read and/or watch to be top of mind for in-class discussions.\n\n## Missing class and assignment policy\nI will provide one unexcused absence for either a class or an assignment (not both). The grade for that class or assignment (since both are weighed equally for grading) will be waived in your final grade. If you miss additional classes and/or assignments, you will receive 0 points unless you have a medical emergency or a similar situation. In such cases, please speak with me or email me separately so we can discuss alternatives. \n\nFor those requesting the class be recorded, I will ask those present if they are okay with recording the session and, if permitted, will upload the video on Canvas. I request that students do not download the video, as this might tempt some to share the recording externally. This act would violate the course's purpose. If I become aware of such sharing, I will not record future class sessions. This class focuses on security, privacy, ethics, and equity. A student who shares the recording beyond the course violates these principles.\n\n## Week 1 Assignment\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## DEADLINE\nDue May 30, at 11:59 PM EDT on Canvas\n::: \n\n### Read\n\n- Chapter 1: Why Is Data Privacy Important?\n- Chapter 2: How Did Data Privacy Change Over Time?\n\n### Watch\n\nCoded Bias ([Netflix link](https://www.netflix.com/title/81328723)). Please let me know ASAP if you cannot watch it.\n\n### Write (600 to 1200 words)\n\nFind and summarize a real-world example of data being used unethically and/or had violated people's privacy. The example must be recent (i.e., since 2021, so after all the examples listed in both “Coded Bias” and the book). Try to keep the following in mind:\n\n- What is the example? Introduce the situation and explain why it is important, providing any relevant background for the reader.\n- How did the example demonstrate a violation of a person's privacy? Does it apply to everyone or only a subgroup of people? Why is that?\n- What are the takeaways from this situation? Has this situation been resolved? Why or why not?\n\n## Week 2 Assignment (No writing) \nNo writing assignment. Make sure to complete week 1 writing assignment.\n\nCome prepared to be engaged in discussion about the various ways data is collected.\n\n### Read\n\n- [Do No Harm Guide: Collecting, Analyzing, and Report Gender and Sexual Orientation Data](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/do-no-harm-guide-collecting-analyzing-and-reporting-gender-and-sexual) – Parts 1, 2, and 3.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\nexercise_number <- 1\n\n```\n\nThis chapter covers the goals and expectations for the DAN 607 course along with the first two assignments (read, watch, and write).\n\n## Goals and expectations\n\nThe primary aim is to foster an understanding of privacy, security, ethics, and equity when using data throughout its life cycle (i.e., from collection to termination).
