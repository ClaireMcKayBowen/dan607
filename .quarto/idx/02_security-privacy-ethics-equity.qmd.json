Whether with first- party data, third-party data, or more, the goal is to give us tags or personas and have computers decide whether and how we ought to be the companies’ targets.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## A Smart TV can help advertisers send an ad to a viewer’s smartphone based on the show they are watching.\n\n**TRUE**\n\nSee answer to question 1.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## A company can tell that I have opened its email even if I don’t click on any links. \n\n**TRUE**\n\nEmail tracking is a method that sends a signal to the sender's server that the email has been opened. Many services use this method (the Urban Institute does this for their newsletters!). However, some email providers, such as Outlook and Gmail, have features that can block this type of tracking. You should check your email settings.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## A website cannot track my activity across devices unless I log into the same account on those devices.\n\n**FALSE**\n\nSee the answers to the previous questions.

HIPAA came into law in 1996 to \"improve portability and continuity of health insurance coverage in the group and individual markets, to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in health insurance and health care delivery, to promote the use of medical savings accounts, to improve access to long-term care services and coverage, to simplify the administration of health insurance, and for other purposes.\" Therefore, HIPAA does not prevent apps that provide information about health from selling data collected about app users to marketers.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Some social media platforms activate users’ smartphone speakers to listen to conversations and identify their interests in order to sell them ads. \n\n**FALSE**\n\nThere has never been a documented case of a social media platform activating users’ smartphone speakers to eavesdrop on conversations and identify their interests for targeted advertising.

For example, many organizations have switched to two factor authentication and VPN to access their systems.\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Data Privacy\n\n**Data Privacy** is the ability \"to determine what information about ourselves we will share with others\" [@fellegi1972question]. Data privacy is a broad topic, which includes data security, encryption, access to data, etc. We will not be covering privacy breaches from unauthorized access to a database (e.g., hackers).\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Confidentiality\n\n**Confidentiality** is \"the agreement, explicit or implicit, between data subject and data collector regarding the extent to which access by others to personal information is allowed\" [@fienberg2018statistical].\n:::\n\n-   There are at least three major threats to data security and privacy.\n\n    1.  **Hackers:** adversaries who steal confidential information through unauthorized access.\n    2.  **Snoopers:** adversaries who reconstruct confidential information from data releases.\n    3.  **Hoarders:** stewards who collect data but don't release the data even if respondents want the information releasesd.\n\n-   There are differing notions of what should and shouldn't be private, which may include being able to opt out of or opt into disclosure protections.\n\n-   Data privacy is a broad topic, which includes data security, encryption, access to data, etc. We will not be covering privacy breaches from unauthorized access to a database (e.g., hackers).\n\n### Ethics and Equity\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Ethics\n\n**Data ethics** is the \"...systemizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct in relation to data, in particular personal data\" [@kitchin2014data].\n:::\n\nMost research institutions and government entities have an Institutional Review Board (IRB), an institution that applies research ethics by reviewing the methods proposed for research involving human subjects, to ensure that the projects are ethical. IRBs **do not** evaluate the quality of the research. They evaluate the the ethical protection of human subjects.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Equity\n\n**Data Equity** is ...\n\n- representation\n- access\n- process\n- outcomes\n- and more\n:::\n\nData equity is also a complex concept, which should be thought of throughout the data life cycle. How do we ensure people are properly represented in data or various organizations in the United States have access to that data to better communities?\n\n::: callout\n#### [`r paste(\"Class Activity\", exercise_number)`]{style=\"color:#1696d2;\"}\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\nexercise_number <- exercise_number + 1\n```\n\n- Prior to starting this course, how would you have defined data security, privacy, ethics, and equity?\n- How has your definition of these different terms changed since the assignments and these discussions? Why or why not?\n\n:::\n\n## Data life cycle\n\nWe've just started exploring the world of security, privacy, ethics, and equity. Throughout this course, we'll integrate these definitions, concepts, and ideas into our discussions, applying them to the data life cycle, which we define as:\n\n- data collection or acquisition (week 2)\n\n- data storage (week 3)\n\n- data sharing and transfer (week 3)\n\n- data analysis (week 4)\n\n- data dissemination (week 5)\n\n- data destruction or termination (week 6)\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## No set taxonomony in the field!\nAll definitions used (including the data life cycle) are my opinionated definitions. Since many different fields work in data security, privacy, ethics, and equity, there is no standard taxonomy, which causes a lot of confusion. I set a standard definition in all my work, including this course, to ensure we are using the same common language.
