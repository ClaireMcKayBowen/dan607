She presented her in the same conference session as me, where she discussed how incomplete data on Asian-American populations risks fueling a vicious circle of inaction and growing inequality. One of her projects compared the socio-demographics of Asian-American respondents reported in four large-scale sample surveys against the same characteristics collected by the US Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, which is often referred to as the gold standard survey on the United States populations and housing information [@tarran2023].\n\nWhen comparing these surveys, Dr. Lee found that the four surveys often differed in important respects. For example, Asian Americans accounted for seven percent of adults aged 18 and over in the American Community Survey. In contrast, the General Social Survey and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey accounted for only four percent and two percent, respectively. The American Community Survey shows 27 percent of Asian-American respondents are educated to high-school level or below, the equivalent grouping in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey accounted for 18 percent.\n\nHowever, none of these surveys, except the American Community Survey, collected data on Asian Americans’ proficiency with spoken English.\n\nAccording to the American Community Survey, 31 percent of Asian-American adults have \"limited English proficiency.\" Dr. Lee's research found that none of the four selected surveys (General Social Survey and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, plus the Current Population Survey and National Health Interview Survey) offered questionnaires in Asian languages; only English and Spanish.\n\nDue to the poorly designed surveys, anyone using these data will find that most Asian Americans are born in the US and/or who have high levels of English proficiency, missing the true geographic and ethnic heterogeneity of the Asian American population. This underrepresentation of certain Asian-American subgroups encourages a potential vicious cycle of having no \"data-driven\" proof to collect such information. This means that issues affecting certain population groups are not identified, meaning no action needs to be taken.\n\nHence, at the end of the presentation, Dr. Lee's slide stated, \"No data, no problem, no action\".\n\n::: callout\n#### [`r paste(\"Class Activity\", exercise_number)`]{style=\"color:#1696d2;\"}\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\nexercise_number <- exercise_number + 1\n```\nAfter learning about this use case, answer the following:\n\n- What is your reaction to this situation?\n- Can you think of other situations where no data would lead to no action, because there no one knows there is a problem?\n\n:::\n\n## Week 3 Assignment\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## DEADLINE\nDue June 6, at 11:59 PM EDT on Canvas\n::: \n\n### Read\n\n- Chapter 3: How Do Data Privacy Methods Expand Access to Data?\n\n### Optional additional read\n\n[Do No Harm Guide: Applying Equity Awareness in Data Privacy Methods](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/do-no-harm-guide-applying-equity-awareness-data-privacy-methods).\n\n### Write (600 to 1200 words)\n\nWe learned that one way to define data equity in the context of privacy is to consider equal privacy loss or equal access for different subgroups.

This underrepresentation of certain Asian-American subgroups encourages a potential vicious cycle of having no \"data-driven\" proof to collect such information. This means that issues affecting certain population groups are not identified, meaning no action needs to be taken.\n\nHence, at the end of the presentation, Dr. Lee's slide stated, \"No data, no problem, no action\".\n\n::: callout\n#### [`r paste(\"Class Activity\", exercise_number)`]{style=\"color:#1696d2;\"}\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\nexercise_number <- exercise_number + 1\n```\nAfter learning about this use case, answer the following:\n\n- What is your reaction to this situation?\n- Can you think of other situations where no data would lead to no action, because there no one knows there is a problem?\n\n:::\n\n## Week 3 Assignment\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## DEADLINE\nDue June 6, at 11:59 PM EDT on Canvas\n::: \n\n### Read\n\n- Chapter 3: How Do Data Privacy Methods Expand Access to Data?\n\n### Optional additional read\n\n[Do No Harm Guide: Applying Equity Awareness in Data Privacy Methods](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/do-no-harm-guide-applying-equity-awareness-data-privacy-methods).\n\n### Write (600 to 1200 words)\n\nWe learned that one way to define data equity in the context of privacy is to consider equal privacy loss or equal access for different subgroups. Answer the following questions:\n\n- Do you agree that these are helpful ways to define equity in the context of privacy?\n- Are there additional ways you would define equity in the context of privacy?\n- Are there other equity considerations to take into account?\n- What are the ethical implications of defining equity in the context of privacy in these ways?"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":true,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["www/styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"02_data-collection.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
