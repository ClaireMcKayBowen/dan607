<p>Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002</p>

<p>CIPSEA establishes uniform confidentiality protections for information collected for statistical purposes by U.S. statistical agencies, and it allows some data sharing between the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and Census Bureau. The agencies report to Office of Management and Budget on particular actions related to confidentiality and data sharing.</p>
<p>The law gives the agencies standardized approaches to protecting information from respondents so that it will not be exposed in ways that lead to inappropriate or surprising identification of the respondent. By default the respondent’s data is used for statistical purposes only. If the respondent gives informed consent, the data can be put to some other use.</p>

<p>The California Privacy Act requires any organization that controls or is controlled by a business that satisfies the California Privacy Act definition to comply.</p>

<p>California Privacy Act requires the organizations that collect personal data to inform consumers what is being collected and allow those consumers to opt-out of the data collection. Companies must then obtain explicit consent to sell or disclose any of that information and provide a process for people to request all that information to be deleted.</p>
<p>There are 31 Sections of the amendment. The book only covered a subset of them, focusing on the changes that transformed and strengthened the California Privacy Act.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Section 8, the amendment expanded this right to opt-out to both the “sale” and “sharing” of consumers’ personal data. The amendment defines “share,” “shared,” or “sharing” as “…renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means” to a third party that does any cross-context behavioral advertising and whether or not the advertising is used for monetary gain.</li>
</ul>
<p>This clarification addresses how businesses operate online advertising and provides consumers the right to delete their personal data. Businesses must also “…notify all third parties to whom the business has sold or shared such personal information, to delete the consumer’s personal information, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.” Furthermore, in Section 14, the amendment updated what qualifies as a “business” by changing the threshold amount of personal information that a business can have from 50,000 to 100,000.</p>
<p>Another expanded consumer right is the right to access personal information indefinitely. The California Privacy Act originally only allowed consumers to request personal information from the previous 12-month time frame.</p>

<!-- ### General Data Protection Regulation -->
<!-- The General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR, is a set of European Union data privacy laws and protections. The 99 articles of GDPR covers a range of topics from what rights does a person have for their personal data to how companies are penalized for violating the law. -->
<!-- #### Key aspects of GDPR -->
<!-- - The data containing identifiers are key for GDPR to consider the information as personal data. -->
<!-- - GDPR separates personal data into two categories: general personal data and sensitive personal -->
<!-- data.  -->
<!-- - Sensitive data is racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, the processing of genetic data and biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, and sex life or sexual orientation. -->
<!-- Revealing this type of personal data is prohibited. GDPR precludes the processing of sensitive personal information and only for special circumstances can a company process such data. -->
<!-- GDPR defines those responsible for protecting personal data, as: -->
<!-- - the *controller* one responsible for deciding the purpose and processing of the personal data. -->
<!-- - the *processor* acts on behalf of the controller while processing personal data. -->
<!-- #### Seven principles for proceessing personal data -->
<!-- GDPR states the seven principles for processing personal data. These seven principles are called: -->
<!-- 1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency; -->
<!-- 2. Purpose Limitation; -->
<!-- 3. Data Minimization; -->
<!-- 4. Accuracy; -->
<!-- 5. Storage Limitation; -->
<!-- 6. Integrity and Confidentiality; and -->
<!-- 7. Accountability. -->
<!-- #### The right to privacy and the right to be forgotten -->
<!-- GDPR monitors what organizations do with people’s personal data, empowers people to control how their personal data are being collected and used by others, and forces organizations to justify anything they do with people’s personal data. -->
<!-- organizations to use personal data if at least one of the six lawful bases apply. These bases are referred as: -->
<!-- 1. consent, which must be “...freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.” -->
<!-- 2. performance of a contract, where a processor requires someone’s personal data to complete specific steps outlined in a contract or prior to entering into a contract. -->
<!-- 3. legal obligation, when a company must use personal data to comply with other laws. -->
<!-- 4. vital interest, where a business can access personal data to protect the person’s life and others. -->
<!-- 5. public interest, such that an organization might perform certain tasks for people’s public interest or to complete official functions. -->
<!-- 6. legitimate interest, where these interests may include situations where someone would expect an organization to collect personal data, use the data in ways that are low-risk, or make a compelling argument on the benefits outweighing the risks. -->

<p>The current standard workflow for statistical data privacy applications includes three main components: (1) data, (2) privacy practitioner(s), and (3) decisionmaker(s). At the start, privacy practitioners review the data (at the least the data schema<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>) and talk with the decisionmakers. From there, the privacy practitioners determine the privacy loss and utility framework of definitions, with possible input from the data and the decisionmakers. Decisionmakers then choose the threshold levels of privacy loss and utility, which depend on the legal or societal context and any practical constraints.</p>
<p>From here, the privacy practitioner selects the statistical data privacy method that meets the desired privacy loss and utility definitions and thresholds. This decision may also use information from the data. Finally, after all the prior decisions are made, the privacy practitioner implements the statistical data privacy method on the data. In some instances, feedback loops exist.</p>

<p>As discussed in the class activity, there are obvious issues with the previous workflow. This is why <span class="citation" data-cites="bowen2023no">Bowen and Snoke (<a href="references.html#ref-bowen2023no" role="doc-biblioref">2023</a>)</span> proposed an aspirational workflow. It is called aspirational because we do not expect every step to always be possible in a real-world implementation. That being said, considering these steps can help make equity part of the process from beginning to end. Below, we describe the six steps of the process in greater detail.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1.-identify-groups-in-the-data">Step 1. Identify Groups in the Data</h4>
<p>The first step is to identify relevant demographic groups in the data, including who the data represents the characteristics that have been collected, and the intended use of the data. For example, a dataset representing organizational entities will have different groups than a dataset representing individuals. Similarly, the dataset may only have limited information about racial/ethnic groups, or it may contain only coarse geographic characteristics. These will place natural limitations on the groups that can be separated.</p>
<p>The choice of demographic groups may also reflect the relevant equity concerns for the expected data. In the recent 2020 Decennial U.S. Census, data practitioners and users raised concerns over equity across rural versus urban geographies and different racial/ethnic groups. This issue led to specific examinations of the impact of the statistical data privacy methods on those groups. However, decisionmakers may not need to use every characteristic in the data to identify groups.</p>

<section id="step-2.-identify-appropriate-representatives-for-the-groups" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2.-identify-appropriate-representatives-for-the-groups">Step 2. Identify Appropriate Representatives for the Groups</h4>
<p>Following the identification of demographic groups, decisionmakers should select appropriate representatives for each group who can speak to the privacy and utility concerns of the group. As we have already discussed, identifying individuals can be a difficult process because groups are not homogenous and will not have singular preferences. Having more than one representative from a group can help to better represent the range of views of that group. How to choose these representatives remains an open question, which we hope future work will explore.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-3.-determine-privacy-and-utility-definitions-and-preferences-with-representatives-and-decisionmakers">Step 3. Determine Privacy and Utility Definitions and Preferences with Representatives and Decisionmakers</h4>
<p>Once group representatives have been consulted, the process can move to developing a private data release. In contrast to the standard workflow, group representatives are involved in these conversations in addition to privacy practitioners and decisionmakers.</p>
<section id="step-3a.-define-statistical-utility-and-privacy-loss" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-3a.-define-statistical-utility-and-privacy-loss">Step 3a. Define Statistical Utility and Privacy Loss</h5>
<p>Decisionmakers and privacy practitioners should decide how to define statistical utility and privacy loss by considering the actual privacy concerns of the group representatives, any legal or policy regulations that must be followed, and the ways that the data release may benefit those represented in the data. Definitions of utility should reflect these benefits. In this way, the tradeoff of privacy and utility, which dictate the final implementation, will be directly related to the perceived harms and benefits of those represented in the data.</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-3b.-choose-group-level-preferences-for-statistical-utility-and-privacy-loss-thresholds">Step 3b. Choose Group-level Preferences for Statistical Utility and Privacy Loss Thresholds</h5>
<p>After selecting relevant definitions, privacy practitioners and decisionmakers should work with group representatives to understand preferences for the privacy-utility tradeoff. A potential outcome may be that some groups have different preferences when it comes to sacrificing privacy for utility or vice versa. At this stage in the process, the goal should be to understand roughly what those preferences look like and how they vary across groups.</p>

<section id="step-4.-communicate-constraints-to-representatives-and-decisionmakers" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-4.-communicate-constraints-to-representatives-and-decisionmakers">Step 4. Communicate Constraints to Representatives and Decisionmakers</h4>
<p>Having selected definitions and worked to understand preferences, the privacy practitioners should communicate the practical constraints to group representatives and decisionmakers. This process will likely end up looking like a feedback loop with step 3b (and potentially 3a) above, because some preferences may not be feasible based on technical constraints. The crucial part of this process is collaboration. Statistical data privacy implementations often have constraints, but there are many alternatives, and selecting the best alternative should be a joint decision.</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-4a.-use-metrics-and-visuals-for-group-level-tradeoff-curves">Step 4a. Use Metrics and Visuals for Group-level Tradeoff Curves</h5>
<p>To help facilitate these conversations, privacy practitioners should produce standard metrics and visuals (e.g., privacy-utility tradeoff curves) across all entities in the data and separately for different demographic groups in the data. The best means of communicating these ideas through metrics or visuals is an open area of work, and we hope that common practices will be developed.</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-4b.-explain-technical-shortcomings-related-to-group-size">Step 4b. Explain Technical Shortcomings Related to Group Size</h5>
<p>Privacy practitioners should be explicit about any technical shortcomings. For instance, current theory and practice do not address the fundamental group size problem. How do you protect the health records of six individuals who are public figures, such as NASA astronauts? Privacy practitioners should not promise that they can achieve the same privacy loss–utility tradeoffs for small, underrepresented groups as they can for larger demographic groups. In many cases, equality of privacy loss or utility will not be possible among groups. Creative solutions to soften this inequality, such as increasing equitable access to restricted-use data that contains detailed information on groups, are needed. We see this as an important area of future work.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-6.-publish-each-step-of-the-process">Step 6. Publish Each Step of the Process</h4>
<p>Every step in the process has limitations, so the entire process must be transparent. Because each of the prior steps is aspirational and may require significant growth in the field, transparency is one of the most immediate actions that practitioners can take. The process could be reported in public presentations, documentations, or regular meetings <span class="citation" data-cites="murray2016data cohen2022guide">(<a href="references.html#ref-murray2016data" role="doc-biblioref">Murray, Falkenburger, and Saxena 2015</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-cohen2022guide" role="doc-biblioref">Cohen et al. 2022</a>)</span>. This transparency allows outside groups and entities to critique the decisions, offer input during the process, and understand what decisions were made. With feedback, each step of the process can be refined, such as selecting group representatives, choosing preferences, or navigating technical shortcomings.</p>

<h2 data-number="11.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="college-scorecard-example"><span class="header-section-number">11.4</span> College Scorecard Example</h2>
<p>The following description is from <span class="citation" data-cites="national2024toward">Reiter et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-national2024toward" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>, which I helped write and lead this part of the report. The College Score card is a great example of how to consider the technical and policy solutions to release confidential data for the public good.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/">College Scorecard</a> involves an approach to blending aggregated data from the Statistics of Income (SOI) Program of IRS with College Scorecard data (U.S. Department of Education) from the Department of Education (ED).</p>
<section id="determine-auspice-and-purpose" class="level3" data-number="11.4.1">
<h3 data-number="11.4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="determine-auspice-and-purpose"><span class="header-section-number">11.4.1</span> Determine auspice and purpose</h3>
<p>The College Scorecard is intended to help future college students and their families search for and compare colleges by field of study, costs, admissions, economic outcomes, and other statistics. Since 2016, ED has provided the College Scorecard as a web-based search tool (i.e., data product) that users can query repeatedly; public-use microdata files are not required. The unit of analysis is the college, and the data are summaries of the features of the college and its students. ED desired to add earning metrics to the College Scorecard. Such blended data could offer the public additional insights into student outcomes at various educational institutions; however, tax records contain very sensitive information and are protected by Title 26, requiring rigorous privacy guarantees.</p>
<p>From <a href="#fig-tech-policy">Figure&nbsp;<span>11.5</span></a>, we might characterize the College Scorecard containing earnings information as being at the intersection of “Modest Impact” usefulness and “Significant and Lasting” disclosure risks.</p>
</section>
<section id="identify-ingredient-data-files" class="level3" data-number="11.4.2">
<h3 data-number="11.4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="identify-ingredient-data-files"><span class="header-section-number">11.4.2</span> Identify ingredient data files</h3>
<p>To create the blended data, ED requires earnings data on college graduates. ED therefore turned to SOI for such data. Education data are subject to FERPA, whereas SOI data are subject to Title 26 rules. This means certain fields may be released as is (e.g., institution), but others require confidentiality protection (e.g., earnings data at the field-of-study or institution level). There is no federal source of average earnings per college, requiring the agencies to blend data at the individual student level. Therefore, the ingredient data file from ED includes recipients of federal student aid,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and the ingredient data file from IRS includes individuals’ earnings. These files need to be linked to accomplish the blending.</p>

<h3 data-number="11.4.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="obtain-ingredient-data-files"><span class="header-section-number">11.4.3</span> Obtain ingredient data files</h3>
<p>Because SOI data derive from tax records, individual students’ earnings cannot be shared outside the agency without special agreements. Thus, SOI needs to blend its data with the data supplied by ED. However, Internal Revenue Code (IRC) § 6108(b) permits SOI to release aggregated-level statistics to ED. The IRC authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to make special statistical studies and compilations involving tax return information as defined in IRC § 6103(b)(2).</p>

<h3 data-number="11.4.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="blend-ingredient-data-files"><span class="header-section-number">11.4.4</span> Blend ingredient data files</h3>
<p>ED provides student-level records—that is, recipients of federal student aid—to SOI to conduct the matching at IRS. The data-sharing arrangement allows SOI to match student information to IRS administrative tax records, which are W-2 (i.e., wage and tax statement) and 1040-SE (i.e., net earnings from self-employment) data. Matching is done on social security numbers.</p>

<h3 data-number="11.4.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="select-disclosure-protection-approaches"><span class="header-section-number">11.4.5</span> Select disclosure-protection approaches</h3>
<p>For the first 3 years of the product, the College Scorecard used classical disclosure approaches (e.g., data suppression, rounding, aggregation, and top-coding) to protect blended data. During this time, ED and SOI continued to reassess the disclosure risk/ usefulness trade-offs of their dissemination strategy. In 2020, ED and SOI wanted to produce a second data file with greater granularity than available at the institution level—one that contained information at the credential and field-of-study level. But SOI became concerned about potential complementary disclosures in creating two datasets from the same ingredient data, as their disclosure approaches did not account for multiple data releases.</p>
<p>SOI also determined that using the classical disclosure approaches to release the second, more granular data file would suppress and alter substantial amounts of blended data, thereby degrading the potential usefulness of the data product.</p>
<p>In an update of disclosure-protection processes, SOI decided to use SafeTables, a software package developed by <a href="ttps://www.tmlt.io/">Tumult Labs</a> that produces statistics from a formally private, noise-addition algorithm. SOI saw three benefits of using a formally private framework. First was the potential ability to quantify privacy risks when releasing datasets. Second was establishing a privacy-loss budget and a mechanism to examine specific points on the disclosure risk/usefulness trade-off. SOI’s final reason was composition: SOI could potentially track total privacy loss across multiple releases of outputs.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Although formal privacy methods are used, the approach of ED and SOI to releasing College Scorecard data is a hybrid between formal privacy and classical disclosure approaches. ED and SOI suppress outputs from SafeTables that differ excessively (per their definition) from the confidential data values to enhance usefulness of published data. Therefore, the end product is not technically formally private; the decision to suppress is based on confidential data values, which violates the formal privacy guarantee. SOI accepted the implied higher disclosure risks, suppressing the noisiest results, because the program deemed it important that students have accurate statistics upon which to make potentially life-changing decisions.</p>

Definition of Formal Privacy
</div>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Although the privacy community has not fully agreed on a common definition, the U.S. Census Bureau<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> defines <strong>formal privacy</strong> as a subset of SDC methods that give “formal and quantifiable guarantees on inference disclosure risk and known algorithmic mechanisms for releasing data that satisfy these guarantees.”</p>
<p>In general, formally private methods have the following features <span class="citation" data-cites="bowen2021philosophy">(<a href="references.html#ref-bowen2021philosophy" role="doc-biblioref">Bowen and Garfinkel 2021</a>)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to quantify and adjust the privacy-utility trade-off, typically through parameters.</li>
<li>Ability to rigorously and mathematically prove the maximum privacy loss that can result from the release of information.</li>
<li>Formal privacy definitions also allow one to <em>compose</em> multiple statistics. In other words, a data curator can compute the total privacy loss from multiple individual information releases.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>To help determine the privacy-loss budget prior to suppressing values, SOI and ED used an evaluation tool called CSExplorer. Also developed by Tumult Labs, this tool allows the client (i.e., SOI and ED) to review and evaluate the disclosure risk/usefulness trade-offs of the output statistics for various privacy-loss budgets. SOI first used the tool to examine the effects of several privacy-loss budgets on various usefulness metrics. Once SOI identified a set of appropriate privacy-loss budgets, ED had access to a limited version of CSExplorer that was in the range of SOI’s selected privacy-loss budgets. ED then could explore the statistical outputs based on those privacy-loss budgets to examine and decide upon which suppression thresholds to use and other specifications for the final data product release.</p>
<p>This tool allowed ED and SOI to have thoughtful, in-depth discussions about trade-offs between privacy and usefulness.</p>

<p>The College Scorecard does not publicize its disclosure-protection processes on its website, and it keeps values of privacy parameters internal. Providing such information along with source code for the disclosure-protection algorithms would improve transparency. <span class="citation" data-cites="national2024toward">Reiter et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-national2024toward" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span> is also unaware of mitigation strategies for potential breaches.</p>
<p>We conclude this case study by mentioning an application with similar goals as the College Scorecard, namely the Census Bureau’s Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes (PSEO) dataset. This data product provides tables of earnings and employment outcomes of graduates from postsecondary institutions <span class="citation" data-cites="foote2019releasing">(<a href="references.html#ref-foote2019releasing" role="doc-biblioref">Foote, Machanavajjhala, and McKinney 2019</a>)</span>, although it does not involve IRS data. The PSEO also applies a formal privacy method to publish the tables.</p>
