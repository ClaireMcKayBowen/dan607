## Types of dissemination



### Recommendations when considering confidentiality
  1. **Report only necessary information.** In other words, do not share additional information, such as dates and locations, if it doesn’t contribute to the dissemination product.
  2. **Avoid reporting inclusion and exclusion criteria for subpopulation analyses.** Don’t discuss these criteria in a way that inadvertently identifies small cells or extreme cases (e.g., suppressed values with less than three that occurred in a census block).
  3. **If possible, have participants review the products.** If the dissemination product contains potentially identifiable information, such as direct quotes, the involved participant should be consulted before the product is released. Even if prior consent was given for the use of direct quotes, project team members should reach out to the individual to confirm permission for publication and attribution of the quote.
  4. **Follow Transparency Initiative requirements.** The American Association for Public Opinion Research Transparency Initiative provides a list of elements that must be disclosed with all publicly and/or proprietary research products (see https://aapor.org/standards-and-ethics/transparency-initiative/). Most dissemination products should cover these basic requirements.

## Time to draw!


Discuss principles of effective data visualization (accuracy, clarity, simplicity).
Data Selection and Preparation (15 minutes):

Provide access to datasets through a shared link or upload files to a cloud storage platform (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.).
Instruct students to choose one dataset to work with. It can be provided by the instructor or sourced independently if feasible.
Visualization Planning (20 minutes):

Students should download the dataset and open it in a spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets).
Decide on at least two different types of data visualizations they will create based on the dataset (e.g., a bar chart and a line graph).
Use the spreadsheet software to create preliminary sketches or outlines of their visualizations, ensuring to label axes, provide titles, and plan color usage effectively.
Creating Visualizations (45 minutes):

Utilize the chosen online collaborative whiteboard tool or spreadsheet software to create the final visualizations.
Students should finalize their visualizations, making sure they accurately represent the data and adhere to best practices in data visualization.
If using a spreadsheet software, create charts and graphs directly within the application and save them for later presentation.
Documentation (10 minutes):

Encourage students to document their process and decisions made while creating each visualization (e.g., choice of chart type, color scheme, insights gained).
Provide a brief explanation for each visualization to facilitate understanding for future reference or presentation.
Reflection (10 minutes):

Prompt students to reflect on their experience independently creating data visualizations.
Ask them to consider challenges encountered, lessons learned, and improvements they would make in future visualizations.
Emphasize the importance of clear and accurate data representation in independent data analysis and reporting.
Submission (5 minutes):

Students should compile their visualizations and documentation into a single document or file (PDF or Word document).
Submit their work electronically through the designated platform (learning management system, email, etc.) as per instructor's guidelines.
Additional Notes:

Ensure students have the necessary technical skills to use the spreadsheet software and online tools effectively.
Provide clear instructions and examples of well-executed data visualizations to guide students in their independent work.
Encourage students to seek feedback from peers or instructors if possible, even in a virtual format, to enhance learning outcomes.
This independent virtual activity allows master level students to develop and demonstrate their proficiency in creating meaningful data visualizations, preparing them for advanced data analysis tasks and professional contexts where independent decision-making and visualization skills are crucial.
