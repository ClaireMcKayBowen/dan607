<!-- Recommendations -->
<!-- #1: Report only necessary information. In other words, do not share additional information, such as dates and locations, if it doesn’t contribute to the dissemination product. -->
<!-- #2: Avoid reporting inclusion and exclusion criteria for subpopulation analyses. Don’t discuss these criteria in a way that inadvertently identifies small cells or extreme cases (e.g., suppressed values with less than three that occurred in a census block). -->
<!-- #3: If possible, have participants review the products. If the dissemination product contains potentially identifiable information, such as direct quotes, the involved participant should be consulted before the product is released. Even if prior consent was given for the use of direct quotes, project team members should reach out to the individual to confirm permission for publication and attribution of the quote. -->
<!-- #4: Follow Transparency Initiative requirements. The Urban Institute is a member of the American Association for Public Opinion Research Transparency Initiative, which provides a list of elements that must be disclosed with all publicly and/or proprietary research products (see https://aapor.org/standards-and-ethics/transparency-initiative/). Your project’s methods write-up should cover these basic requirements.  -->
<!-- If you are concerned about whether outputs may be too sensitive to report, please consult with the Data Governance and Privacy Practice Area. -->
