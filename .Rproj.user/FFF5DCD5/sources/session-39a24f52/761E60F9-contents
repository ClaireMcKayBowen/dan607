## Hiding the real data story

From the required reading, we learned that we must carefully take into account how the data are collected, analyzed, disseminated. If we don't, we risk missing a vital piece of the data story, especially when data sets are aggregated, and cause more unintended harm to those we are trying to protect.

For your assignment this week, you had to find a news analysis story[^story] published within the last year (2023 – present).

[^story]: "An article written to inform readers about recent events. The author reports and attempts to deepen understanding of recent events—for example, by providing background information and other kinds of additional context." – [CSUSM Library](https://libguides.csusm.edu/news/different_news_types)

::: callout
#### [`r paste("Class Activity", exercise_number)`]{style="color:#1696d2;"}

```{r}
#| echo: false

exercise_number <- exercise_number + 1
```

Describe the news analysis story you wrote about for your writing assignment and discuss the following questions:

  - How do the claims made in the article apply to your life, family, or community?
  - Who authored the article, and how might their background influence its content?
  - Do you have any doubts or concerns about the contents in the article? If so, what are they?
  - How could the story change with an increase or decrease in available data?

## Give me the real stats!


::: callout
#### [`r paste("Class Activity", exercise_number)`]{style="color:#1696d2;"}

```{r}
#| echo: false

exercise_number <- exercise_number + 1
```
You will be given 30 minutes (check in on progress at 15 minutes) to complete this in-class activity.

Each of you have been assigned a random "fact" (see table below).

For your assigned question, come up with at least two different statistics that are technically correct but seem to contradict each other based on the United States. For each statistic, answer the following:

  - What information did you use to answer your question?
  - Did the digital object that contained the information follow the FAIR principles?
  - How did you access that information?
    - Was the storage and transfer of that information consider security and privacy?
  - How did you use that information to answer your question?
  - Do you have any ethical and/or equity concerns about this information?
