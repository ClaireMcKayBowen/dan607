For this week, we will learn the importance of destroying or terminating data.

## Quick recap on week 5

### Data privacy laws in the United States of America

The laws governing data collection and dissemination are limited to specific federal agencies (e.g., U.S. Census Bureau) or specific data types (e.g., education).

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives consumers more control over the personal information that businesses collect about them, with accompanying regulations that provide guidance on how to implement the law. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 24, the California Privacy Rights Act, which amended the CCPA and added additional privacy protections that took effect on January 1, 2023.

#### A Framework for Managing Disclosure Risks in Blended Data

  1. Determine auspice and purpose of the blended data project.
  
      a. What are the anticipated final products of data blending?
      b. What are potential downstream uses of blended data?
      c. What are potential considerations for disclosure risks and harms, and data usefulness?
    
  2. Determine ingredient data files.
  
      a. What data sources are available to accomplish blending, and what are the interests of data holders?
      b. What steps can be taken to reduce disclosure risks and enhance usefulness when compiling ingredient files?
    
  3. Obtain access to ingredient data files.
  
      a. What are the disclosure risks associated with procuring ingredient data?
      b. What are the disclosure risk/usefulness trade-offs in the plan for accessing ingredient files?
    
  4. Blend ingredient data files.
  
      a. When blending requires linking records from ingredient files, what linkage strategies can be used?
      b. Are resultant blended data sufficiently useful to meet the blending objective?
    
  5. Select approaches that meet the end objective of data blending.
  
      a. What are the best-available scientific methods for disclosure limitation to accomplish the blended data objective, and are sufficient resources available to implement those methods?
      b. How can stakeholders be engaged in the decision-making process?
      c. What is the mitigation plan for confidentiality breaches?
    
  6. Develop and execute a maintenance plan.
  
      a. How will agencies track data provenance and update files when beneficial?
      b. What is the decision-making process for continuing access to or sunsetting the blended data product, and how do participating agencies contribute to those decisions?
      c. How will agencies communicate decisions about disclosure management policies with stakeholders?

### Types of dissemination

### Data visualizations

Similar to outlining a presentation, don't race to the computer. Start with paper and pen (or color pencils/markers!), chalkboard and chalk, etc. to sketch out your data visualization.

- Show the data
- Reduce the clutter
- Integrate the graphics and text
- Avoid Speghetti chart
- Start with gray

## Data destruction or termination

Upon project completion, your team should consider the physical destruction of all copies of confidential data as required by contract (e.g., data use agreement). Alternatively, after three years, you should remove all identifiers from the data and maintain a name-code index separately in a secure location.

## Contract for data destruction
Projects involving confidential data—such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Health Information (PHI), or credit card information—typically include a clause requiring data destruction within a specified period after the project's end. The data destruction must be carried out using acceptable methods, often specified for "readily accessible storage." Some contracts require proof of data destruction, which some companies have a process to create a Certificate of Destruction (or something equivalent). Your contract may also stipulate that this process must be witnessed and/or notarized, necessitating a witness to confirm the data destruction.
:::

Most private companies and other entities have their own policies for data disposal. Generally, acceptable methods fall into two categories: logical and physical.

### Logical

Logical destruction involves erasing data with multiple read/write commands, such as those performed by Pretty Good Privacy[^PGP] File Shredder or by emptying the file system’s recycle bin.

[^PGP]: “Pretty Good Privacy is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication.” from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy

### Physical

Physical disposal involves destroying the data media itself, such as shredding paper documents and CDs/DVDs, degaussing magnetic media, or drilling holes through hard drives.
