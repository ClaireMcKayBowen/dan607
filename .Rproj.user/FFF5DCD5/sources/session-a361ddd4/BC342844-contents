<p>Our first lesson on professional non-technical skills focuses on written and verbal communication. This is one of the hardest professional skills to learn and master. Even those who have been in their professions for many years that require extensive verbal and written communication often struggle with it.</p>
<p>As a valuable resource, I strongly suggest reading “Great on the Job” by Jodi Glickman <span class="citation" data-cites="glickman2011great">[@glickman2011great]</span>. This book offers excellent insights on improving workplace communication, which I’ve personally found beneficial in my professional interactions.</p>
<p>Many of the tips on this page come from insights gained from the book, my own experiences, and advice received from other professionals.</p>

<p>The general idea here is to avoid assuming that everyone knows who you are, your affiliation with a school or company, or how you were connected to them.</p>
<p>I took a similar approach in our initial email exchange for this course. Given my role as an adjunct professor rather than full-time faculty at Stonehill College, I’ve provided a more detailed introduction to offer some background.</p>

Email to 2024 DAN 607 Students

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>I am Claire Bowen, your instructor for DAN 607: Security, Privacy, and Ethics. I am a senior fellow and lead the Data Governance and Privacy Team at the Urban Institute; a non-profit, non-partisan, public policy research institute HQed in Washington DC. However, I am a remote worker in Santa Fe, NM. My research focuses on developing technical and policy solutions aimed at safely expanding access to confidential data for advancing evidence-based policy-making. If interested, you can learn more here.</p>

<p>This next example is how a colleague introduced himself to me. Even though he worked at Urban at the same time I did, several months had passed, and we never worked on a project together. He didn’t presume that I remembered him and made sure to clearly state who he is and our prior connection.</p>

<p>Hi Claire,</p>
<p>This is Eric Smith – a former colleague from Urban. I’m currently on detail to the Treasury Department, where I sit on the racial equity team here supporting on efforts related to research and data. A big part of my role is engaging with the Office of Tax Policy on efforts related to equity and tax administration.</p>
<p>[removed the middle part of the email to focus on the introduction]</p>
<p>I can share more once we find a time to talk. Would you have time to chat this week? Sooner would be preferable if that works.</p>

<p>I hope you’re doing well.</p>
<p>I would like to introduce you to Naomi Goldberg, the incoming Executive Director of the <a href="https://www.lgbtmap.org/">Movement Advancement Project</a>. She recently saw the latest <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/do-no-harm-guide-collecting-analyzing-and-reporting-gender-and-sexual">Do No Harm Guide on Collecting, Analyzing, and Report Gender and Sexual Orientation Data</a> and wanted to connect with the people behind the report.</p>
<p>Naomi, this is <a href="https://www.urban.org/author/jonathan-schwabish">Jon Schwabish</a>, senior fellow in the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute. He is the mastermind on the <a href="https://www.urban.org/projects/do-no-harm-project">Do No Harm Guide project</a>, a series of guides on how researchers and practitioners can better approach their work with a DEI lens.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>Next, it’s crucial to clearly state the purpose of the conversation. This should follow immediately after the introduction and should be concise, ideally in one or two sentences. The goal of any verbal and written communication is to ensure clarity within the first three sentences, as most people are busy and tend to skim emails or only listen for the first 15 seconds. This approach helps the recipient prioritize their responses, especially in cases where they receive a high volume of emails, such as myself, who typically receives around 50 emails a day.</p>
<p>In this next example, I’m reaching out to colleagues at a state office following a training session on data privacy techniques, specifically synthetic data generation. Given our recent communications, I skipped reintroducing myself and proceed directly to the purpose of this email after a brief greeting.</p>

<p>Dear Claire,</p>
<p>I am working to submit a nomination for Emilee Allen for the ASA mentoring award; see https://www.amstat.org/your-career/awards/asa-mentoring-award. Emilee identified you as someone who could speak to her mentoring impact on your career, so I was hoping to get your help.</p>
<p>If you could either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide me with a few sentences on the impact of Emilee’s mentoring on your career. If any of that interaction was in the early part of your career, please stress those points (per the ASA announcement). OR</li>
<li>Write a letter of support – which can be no more than 2 pages – to include in the submission.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are willing to write a letter I can pull from that to write the overall nomination.</p>
<p>I know you are extremely busy, so I would be very appreciative of any information you can provide.</p>
<p>The nomination package is due March 1st, but I am hoping to have all information assembled by February 1.</p>
<p>Please hit reply all to this email as I am CCing my new email at the University at Buffalo (where I will start as Chair of Biostatistics in February).</p>

<p>In addition to <span class="citation" data-cites="glickman2011great">@glickman2011great</span>’s structure, frame your requests into questions. Often our first emails to someone new are because we need to ask them something. This is already hard for verbal communication let alone written communication, where tone is hard to convey. If you have a request for someone, rephrase it like a question. It will sound more like the intent (a request) rather than a demand.</p>

<p>The email follows the recommended structure, but the tone is off because the request sounds like a demand.

<p>The following is an email from a colleague who had asked me about how to explain a privacy concept, differential privacy, at a high level for a presentation.

Conceptual question on differential privacy

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><strong>Thanks Claire:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Great insight, very helpful.</strong> It’s an interesting exercise that helps me better understand what’s going on. The strategic spending of privacy bucks suggest some design/strategy ideas (giving away my operations research degree)…in some settings, it might be worth asking the same question a few times to get a sense of variability (with a cap on the number of questions, you might not be able to ask enough times to get a good estimate of the variance, but you might gain insight on the potential magnitude to some order…).</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for the thoughts on this,</strong> I’m going to the Federal Cmt on Stat Methods next week and am summarizing some of our work…there are other talks in my session on DP, specifically, but I wanted to have an intuition-building statement before jumping to results. This was great. I’ll keep thinking about it and feel free to send any further thoughts. <strong>You do a really nice job of explaining these issues!</strong></p>

<p>As <span class="citation" data-cites="glickman2011great">@glickman2011great</span> states,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Every conversation presents an opportunity to build upon and expand your network. With each new itneraction, you have an opportunity to establish or build rapport and leverage professional relationships going forward. Building on the “thank you” is where the true skill comes in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are numerous methods to sustain that momentum or identifying potential next steps. This could be as straightforward as saying, “I look forward to staying in touch.” or suggesting, “Let’s connect on LinkedIn.” The latter is my go to, especially when meeting people at networking events like professional conferences. It’s a low effort way of staying connected in some way.</p>
<p>In the following example, staff from the a state’s Department of Health contacted me regarding alternative data privacy methods aimed at avoiding the suppression or removing public health data records. The forward momentum is opening the door for further questions.</p>

<p>I met a colleague at a workshop, and we discussed a job posting in his organization and his difficulties finding qualified candidates.

<li>The persuasive argument - making the case for someone to take action</li>
<li>Missing/outstanding information - sharing news in the face of imperfect information</li>
</ol>
<p>Similar to the previous section, we will examine the components/recipe for these types of information and provide real examples. This section is a little repetitive, so you can skip parts of it and reference the examples later.</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>Key facts / supporting highlights</li>
<li>Forward momentum</li>

<p>The purpose of this type of communication is to provide new, different, and/or important information. When drafting your email or considering what to say, think about your objective or what you hope to achieve from the conversation.</p>

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>I’m reaching out to you to see if would be willing to come to Urban in-person to give a talk. In 2022, lots of people really enjoyed your talk and conversations, so we’d love to have you back. <em>[punchline]</em></p>
<p>The researchers in the Impact Methods group (Hanson is the contact person and is cced to this email) and the Statistical Methods Group are hoping that you would teach about use of propensity score methods (PSM) for impact analysis. Perhaps a talk along the lines of your presentation on the “Why, When, and How of PSM for Causal Effects” (that Ben found online, also cced to the email). The goal would be to give folks a grounding in what PSM is, how it works, when it’s useful vs.&nbsp;a bad idea, things to check to make sure it’s used properly, and pitfalls and potential solutions. Do you have a take on a good length for this workshop/talk? If an hour seems too tight, we’re thinking that 90 minutes would be fine too. If it works for you, we’d also like you to talk with folks before and after your talk. <em>[key facts]</em></p>
<p>Is scheduling something between now and June still possible? We’ve got a budget to cover your time as we did before.</p>
<p>Please let me know your thoughts on this. <em>[next steps]</em></p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience! After some internal discussion, we were wondering if you would be open to sending a few introduction slides on propensity score methods (PSM). These slides would serve as a basis for a pre-session targeted at junior staff and those unfamiliar with PSM, likely led by Matt at Urban. This pre-session would also help us promote your talk. <em>[punchline]</em></p>
<p>For the main talk, we propose that you spend 10 to 15 minutes providing an introduction to ensure everyone is aligned on key terminology and concepts before delving into more intermediate topics for the rest of the 90 minutes, followed by advanced topics during the discussion portion. This structure would also allow attendees the option to come back or leave early after the lunch break, depending on their interest on more advance topics. <em>[key facts]</em></p>
<p>The outline could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>PSM talk (90 minutes)
<ul>
<li>10 to 15 minutes on intro to PSM</li>
<li>75 minutes on more intermediate PSM concepts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Break (30 to 45 minutes - lunch break)</li>
<li>Discussion (45 minutes)

<li>Advance PSM topics + Q&amp;A</li>

<p>I’ve been giving some thought to the possibility of making another attempt at the award nomination, and I wanted to discuss it with you. I think we should try again this year (2024). <em>[punchline/case]</em></p>
<p>Trying again wouldn’t be as arduous as last time, with only updates/edits needed for the new nomination. The downside is we need to reach out to letter writers again. <em>[key facts]</em></p>
<p>What are your thoughts? <em>[next steps]</em></p>
<p>Claire</p>

<p>This next example involves me reaching out to several colleagues to nominate a mutual colleague for an award, which will require several letters of recommendation (good letters take a lot of time to write!).</p>

Nominating Amy for an award
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Dear colleagues,</p>
<p>I’m writing to discuss the possibility of nominating Amy for THE AWARD, recognizing individuals who have significantly contributed to advancing opportunities for women in statistics. <em>[punchline/case]</em></p>
<p>In addition to her numerous accomplishments for our profession, I have been fortunate to benefit from Amy’s mentorship throughout my career. We initially connected at my first Joint Statistical Meetings<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, where Amy reached out to me afterward to maintain our connection and provide me an opportunity to present at NSF/NCSES<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. Since then, we have met at every Joint Statistical Meetings and other events, engaging in discussions on identifying research problems, navigating career transitions, addressing the challenges of the two-body problem, maintaining work-life balance, and more. <em>[key facts]</em></p>
<p>Prior to approaching Amy regarding this nomination, I wished to reach out to you—her esteemed colleagues throughout her career—to gauge alignment on whether Amy exemplifies the values and accomplishments akin to THE AWARD. I fully acknowledge that I am biased in believing she should be nominated for this award, which is why I am reaching out to you. Should you agree and upon securing Amy’s consent for the nomination, would you or someone within your network agree to drafting a letter of recommendation? The application deadline is Dec.&nbsp;15, and I will ensure timely reminders to facilitate our submission process. <em>[next steps]</em></p>
<p>Your thoughts and comments are appreciated!</p>

<p>We often need to discuss missing information or identifying next steps for a situation or project.

If you find yourself in this situation, start from scratch and try to level set for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Below is part of an email exchange, where there was confusion about payments for a contract between Organization A and Urban Institute (my project). In this email, I try to establish what is known to figure out what we are missing and identify the next steps.</p>

Contract confusion

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I wanted to touch base and ensure we’re on the same page about the contract between Organization A and Urban. There seems to be some uncertainty about the duration and amounts. <em>[punchline]</em></p>
<p>Attached is the original Urban subgrant agreement, which states two project years: Year 1 spanning from February 2023 to January 2024, and Year 2 spanning from February 2024 to January 2025. According to the agreement, the first payment of $13,920 was due on February 1, 2023, with the second payment of $6,960 scheduled for March 1, 2024.</p>
<p>Organization A has already issued the payment for Year 1, and the first email in this email thread contains the invoice Kevin (Urban) sent for Year 2. <em>[outstanding items]</em></p>
<p>Erin, could you clarify whether your previous email confirms Organization A’s intent to pay Year 2? If not, could you and/or Gabe provide an explanation for this decision? <em>[next steps]</em></p>
<p>Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope this clarifies things.</p>

<p>For the next email, I reached out to the staff in charge of travel approvals. I received several notifications about how my travel was approved and then rejected multiple times. I became unsure if my travel was approved or not and if I needed to do anything to help with the process.</p>

<p>My vice president recently shared this <a href="https://www.behance.net/blog/email-etiquette-for-the-super-busy">blog</a> by Fred Wilson on general tips for a “less is more” strategy for emails.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="be-concise">Be Concise</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Do you like getting long emails? No? No one does. A good rule of thumb is to strive to keep emails to one line or less. If they can’t be that short, challenge yourself to keep them as concise as humanly possible. Your contact is likely to be checking the message on a smartphone as on a desktop computer, or receiving many emails and in-person requests a day. Shorter is easier to digest – which means you’re more likely to get a response.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being concise is part of <span class="citation" data-cites="glickman2011great">@glickman2011great</span>’s three C’s:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be concise.</strong> No one likes to read a one-page email or listen to four-minute voice mail if he/she/they doesn’t have to. Be short and sweet, and to the point.</li>
<li><strong>Be clear.</strong> Don’t jump around topics or make people guess at your meaning or intentions. Clearly state your position, give the info you need to share, get the buy-in of your audience (if necessary), and move on.</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent.</strong> Using a consistent pattern to relay information will enable you to anticipate follow-up questions and/or think about missing pieces of information before giving someone an update-keeping you one step ahead of the curve.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="communicate-action-steps-first-not-last">Communicate “action steps” first, not last</h3>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It’s standard practice to begin an email by summarizing what happened at a meeting or during a phone conversation, then following on with any “action steps” that emerged. But this makes it easy for the most important information to get lost in the shuffle. By reversing this order – and listing actions steps first and foremost – you keep the attention on the items you want to draw attention to.</p>

Invitation to join a new Research Coordination Network

<p>Dear Claire,</p>
<p>I am writing to you on behalf of the Future of Privacy Forum (FPF). Through a grant from the National Science Foundation (grant number 2413978), we are building a Research Coordination Network (RCN) dedicated to advancing the development, deployment, and practical application of Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to support socially beneficial data sharing and analytics.</p>
<p>I wondered if you might have a few minutes to connect with me to discuss potential topics for the RCN and determine if you might be interested in participating yourself.</p>
<p>[removed paragraphs about the proposed RCN]</p>
<p>If you do have a few moments, I would love to connect – I’d be happy to fit into your schedule and/or send you a link to book a time!</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>The planning committee is back with some updates/questions/comments to share.</p>
<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The conference website is updated to include a schedule page, a registration page, and an updated support page. Please take a look and let us know if any updates are needed.</li>
<li>We recommend poster size of 36x48 and we are happy with whatever format the program committee decides on.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Are you open to drop Day 2 roundtables and do a boxed lunch on Day 2 in case some attendees would need to catch a flight and leave early?</li>
<li>Do we want to add a “closing (by co-chairs)” somewhere on Day 2 and if so when? The idea is to mostly make attendees stay till after lunch.</li>
</ol>
<p>It would be good to finalize the conference schedule soon so that registered attendees can make travel plans, among other things.</p>
<p>Thanks and we look forward to hearing your thoughts on the above updates and questions. Have a wonderful weekend!</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Emails that offer nothing but a “What do you think about X…?” are generally ineffectual. Always be proactive and take the lead in your communications so that the way forward is completely clear. If you’re proposing a deal, do a bullet‐pointed outline of the parameters from the get‐go. If you want to “run something by” a superior, share your approach and ask them if they agree. They may not, but giving them a starting point, something to react to, is MUCH more likely to get a response than waiting for someone else to make the first move.</p>

Project update and questions for next steps

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Hi Kim,</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience. I intended to send you an update earlier this week, but when I returned from PTO, I found myself busier than anticipated.</p>
<p>I reviewed the code book and data. To ensure we’re on the same page, I’ve drafted a document that outlines the synthesis project, detailing objectives for privacy and utility, along with expectations. Additionally, I’ve compiled a table of variables, their descriptions, and considerations for synthesis.</p>
<p>If possible, I would like for you to review this document to ensure that I have correctly captured the essential information regarding the project’s overarching goals and confirmed the correct subset of the data (which I believe pertains to the court cases).</p>
<p>Also, if you have any initial thoughts regarding synthesis considerations, please share them with me.</p>

<p>Some people think that handing out deadlines can seem dictatorial. On the contrary, I’ve noticed that successful busy people welcome a deadline.

If a response from them is imperative, politely include a deadline: “For the project to stay on track, I need a response from you by 1/18.” If a response is optional, communicate that as well: “If I don’t hear back from you by 1/18, I’ll proceed with the solution I’ve proposed.”</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Email is a severely limited medium when it comes to conveying tone, which is why angry emails are never a good idea. More often than not, they just create more anxiety – and more email. Occasionally, writing an angry email can be therapeutic. If this is the case, write it as a draft to get it off your chest, and then delete the email. When a confrontation is brewing, a conversation in person or on the phone is almost always best. Emails leave too much room for misunderstanding.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-do-you-explore-new-job-opportunities">How do you explore new job opportunities…</h3>
<p><strong>while being respectful of your current employer and avoiding the “grass is greener” syndrome?</strong></p>
<p>We will break down the answer to this question in four parts.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Keep your materials up-to-date:</strong> Start by updating your resume, LinkedIn profile, and other professional materials. Personally, I update my CV/resume about every month, typically during the first week. In my field, it’s common to have an updated CV for grant and contract applications. If you regularly maintain your resume or professional social media presence, it won’t raise suspicions with your employer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Think about why you are seeking another opportunity:</strong> Reflect on the key reasons for wanting to leave your current position. Is it a temporary annoyance, or is it a systemic issue that, if unresolved, will continue to affect your happiness?</p>
<p>For example, one of the most common reasons for leaving a job is having a difficult supervisor. Even if you enjoy your work, colleagues, and company, a bad supervisor can be a compelling reason to leave. Supervisors play a crucial role in advocating for key changes on your behalf, finding professional opportunities, and advancing your career. They are often responsible for your raises and promotions. Without a supportive supervisor, your career may stagnate or become difficult to advance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Schedule interviews outside of work hours:</strong> When scheduling interviews, try to arrange them outside of your work hours. It is unethical to use work time for interviews. Some people take time off, make up the hours later in the day, or schedule interviews outside of their regular work hours.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wrap up your projects neatly:</strong> As a supervisor who oversees several people, my biggest request before someone leaves is that they wrap up their projects and responsibilities neatly. This means leaving clear instructions, passing on knowledge, and identifying someone who can serve as a backup until a new person is hired. Additionally, take on quick tasks that can be completed before your departure to help your colleagues with bigger projects.</p>
<p>For example, one of my team members who helped managed my largest projects was leaving for graduate school. I had already identified a new person to take over her responsibilities. I asked the departing employee to train the new person, clean up the project directory, create read-me files or instructions for each subdirectory/responsibility, and meet with the new person to walk through those materials and responsibilities.</p></li>

Unpopular opinion: Proceed with caution!

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>I once received advice to apply for a job occasionally (e.g., once a year) even if you are happy with your current position. Applying for new positions informs you about how competitive your skills are in the job market (i.e., what you are worth). You may learn something new about yourself or what you value. You may also discover an even better opportunity than you currently have.</p>

</div>
<p>It goes without saying that most people (myself included) do not like writing cover letters. However, a good cover letter is important and should be customized to the job, highlighting how your experiences align with the job description. A cover letter typically has the following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Formal greeting:</strong> The greeting is usually to the hiring manager to the hiring committee (if known). If unknown, you can use something generic like “Dear Hiring Manager.”</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Dear [Hiring Manager’s Name or Group],</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction:</strong> The first paragraph or few sentences should state the position you are applying for, mention how you found out about the job opening (this is nice to know as the hiring manager), and provide a brief statement about why you are interested in the position or the company.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I am excited to apply for the position of [Position Name] at [Company Name] that was posted on [Where You Found the Job Posting]. With my background in [Your Field or Industry] and experience in [Relevant Experience], I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Or you could have the following for the last sentence.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Please accept this letter and my resume as my application for the position.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Body Paragraphs:</strong> The next two or three paragraphs should highlight your most recent and relevant experiences and how they match the job posting. Be specific! Simply stating that you are “organized” or “a good communicator” does not demonstrate this to the hiring manager. Provide specific examples from your experience to illustrate these qualities.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I feel that my qualifications are well matched to the posted job description and requirements. I am seeking an opportunity to challenge and build upon my knowledge and experiences. At present, I am [Role, Responsibilities, Skills, etc.]. This experience has equipped me with the skills necessary to [Relevant Experience].</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Usually in second to last paragraph, you want to say why you are good fit for the company and why you are interested in that company.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>My experiences, skills, and drive have prepared me to be an invaluable contributor to the [Company]. Moreover, being a part of [Company] would be ideal for my career as it would [Your Professional Goal and Alignment with Company Values/Mission].</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Closing paragraph:</strong> This paragraph should reiterate your interest in the position, mention how to find more information (if not already stated at the beginning), explain how they can contact you for next steps, and thank the hiring manager for considering your application.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I am eager in taking the next step in this process, please feel free to contact me by phone or email. I appreciate you taking the time to review my application, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Another example.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I am excited to bring my skills and experience to [Company]. I have attached my resume for your review and would love the opportunity to discuss further how my background, skills, and certifications will contribute to your team. Thank you for considering my application.</p>

Heavily edit AI cover letters!
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>If you’re going to use AI like ChatGPT to write your cover letter, make sure to heavily edit it afterward. <strong>AI is a tool, not a crutch.</strong> I’m currently reviewing job applications, and I can easily tell which ones were created with AI. The bonus for me is knowing which applicants to ignore.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say you shouldn’t use AI. HR and other companies are obviously using AI to filter applicants, so why not use the tool to help you? However, as I said, don’t just generate the cover letter without editing it to add your own voice. One of the applicants my colleague and I invited for a phone screen stood out mostly due to her cover letter being so unique and thoughtful.</p>

<p>Here are some general tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Research your interviewers (if you know who they are).</strong> They will likely look you up, so it’s only fair you do the same. One candidate impressed me by reading a couple of my papers and sharing his thoughts during the interview.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prepare an introduction about yourself</strong> that is concise, with a longer version ready if asked to elaborate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research the company</strong> and be ready to explain why you’re applying for the role and why you want to work for the company.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dress appropriately and arrive on time</strong> if the interview is in person. For virtual interviews, ensure good sound quality, a suitable background, proper lighting, and a functioning camera. First impressions matter, even on video calls.</p></li>

Practice your handshake
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>If you feel your handshake isn’t strong, consider practicing it with family, friends, or anyone willing to provide honest feedback. I understand it can be challenging for men, as they may worry about exerting too much pressure on women’s hands. However, women have the advantage in this regard, as we are less likely to apply excessive force. So, don’t hesitate to give a firm handshake!</p>
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Take your time if needed.</strong> It’s okay to say, “Can I have a moment to think about this question?” before answering. It’s better to gather your thoughts than to give a rushed or repetitive answer. Interviewers appreciate clear and concise responses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Speak clearly and confidently.</strong> If the interview is on video or in person, try to smile and show enthusiasm, even if you’re nervous. Some roles require strong public speaking skills.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prepare your own questions for the interviewer.</strong> Remember, you’re also interviewing them!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Follow up with a thank-you note</strong> reiterating your interest in the position.</p></li>

<section id="how-to-negotiate-salaries" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-negotiate-salaries">How to negotiate salaries?</h3>
<p>Before delving into salary negotiations, it’s essential to research the typical salary range for the specific role and responsibilities, taking into account the geographical location. Professional societies such as the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/your-career/salary-information">American Statistical Association conduct surveys among their members</a>, gathering valuable salary data. Additionally, consider reaching out to friends and family occupying similar positions, if they’re willing to share their salary information. While discussing salaries is often considered taboo, breaking this silence can be empowering for employees, rather than solely benefiting employers.</p>
<p>Many employers are obligated to disclose salary ranges, although some ranges may not be ideal (e.g., very wide). As a hiring manager, understanding your salary expectations is crucial, as it enables me to gauge whether my company can offer a suitable salary within that range (bearing in mind that I have limited control over the predetermined salary bands). This ensures that neither your time nor mine is wasted, minimizing frustration for both parties involved.</p>
<p>When presented with a salary offer, whether verbally or written, it’s advisable not to immediately accept or reject it. If the offer is verbal, take a moment before responding, expressing gratitude for the offer without revealing your opinion on its adequacy. You should mull over the offer for at least a day, carefully considering the other benefits such as vacation time and healthcare provisions in addition to the compensation.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-effective-ways-to-stay-organized">What are effective ways to stay organized?</h3>
<p>Understanding what drives you or what triggers your need for organization is key. For instance, I thrive on maintaining an “inbox zero” approach. To align with this, I create subfolders within my inbox to categorize emails related to projects, administrative tasks, and more. Each email must be addressed and filed in the appropriate folder before I can clear it from my main inbox.</p>

<p>Another strategy I employ is keeping essential information visible. I use my whiteboard to track my professional travel schedule, paper reviews, and the progress of paper publications. This whiteboard also helps me see if I’ve been overcommitting on these areas.</p>
<p>For day-to-day tasks, I rely on a notebook. At the start of each day, I list the top 2 to 4 priorities I aim to accomplish. Alongside, I maintain a to-do list, tackling tasks based on their importance and urgency. Breaking down larger projects into smaller, manageable steps also helps maintain clarity and progress.</p>

<p>To ensure I never miss deadlines, I maintain a secondary calendar dedicated solely to reminders. This calendar prompts me to complete tasks and also reminds others of their responsibilities. I strongly recommend implementing a similar system. Examples of reminders I set include “set agenda for W meeting,” “create announcement for X,” “send email reminder for Y,” and “send follow-up if Z doesn’t respond.”</p>

<p>Public speaking remains one of the top fears among people in the United States. Becoming a good public speaker requires a lot of practice. Yet, even with extensive practice, some people may struggle to become compelling and engaging speakers.</p>
<p>The purpose of this final is to help you achieve 90% of the goal by ensuring your slides and content are well-organized.

<p>Typically, the presentation structure is as follows, resembling a pyramid in terms of content and time:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Previous literature</li>
<li>Data</li>
<li>Methods</li>
<li>Results</li>
<li>Conclusions</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it should be more like an hourglass. You want to spend more time getting people hooked at the beginning and then dedicate more time on the conclusions and takeaway at the end.</p>

<p>Our focus will be on engaging trustees in our strategic planning process. As a precursor to strategic planning, we want to illustrate the various kinds of work that Urban does today that trustees can understand our theory of change before diving into big strategy thinking. Therefore, we are planning a content segment titled “Understanding Urban’s Work”, where five experts would present on concrete examples of different types of Urban’s work and how we bring insight from evidence to point of decision, to help changemakers accelerate solutions.</p>
<p>Each presentation would be about five minutes long, followed by seven minutes of questions and/or discussion by trustees. Donald Marron has agreed to moderate the segment and facilitate the presentations and respective Q&amp;A. Would you be willing to present on the IRS Data and Validation Server project and how it makes an impact?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What type of presentation are you giving?:</strong> A 5-minute presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your audience?:</strong> Urban Institute’s <a href="https://www.urban.org/about/our-people/board-of-trustees">Board of Trustees</a>, diverse technical backgrounds, but all interested in evidence-based public policymaking.</p>
<p><strong>What is the headline message of your presentation?:</strong> Advance the promise of more evidence-based public policymaking using administrative data.</p>
<p><strong>What do you want your audience to do with your conclusion?:</strong> To continue to support data science and data privacy methods to safely expand access to confidential administrative data.</p>

<p>For example, Raj Chetty and colleagues have used tax data to study economic mobility across generations and how elementary school teacher quality affects economic outcomes later in life. However, full access to these data are only available to select government agencies, a very limited number of researchers working in collaboration with analysts in those agencies, or through highly selective research programs run by these agencies.</p>
<p>So, how can we expand access to administrative tax data to other researchers, government officials, and public policymakers instead of the select few like Raj Chetty? This is where our team comes in. We are developing new data science tools to allow researchers access to sensitive data while providing more robust privacy protection. This new technology can also be applied to other administrative data!</p>
<p>Now is the ideal time to develop such new technology and methodology as the Evidence Act commits the federal government to expand access to data along with Biden’s executive order, directing federal agencies and White House offices to examine barriers to racial equity and initiate several efforts to address equity for people of color and underserved communities. Furthermore, Len Burman, an institute fellow and co-PI on this body of work, is a member of the Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building, which Urban is supporting with internal funds.</p>

<p>So, how does our data science tools work to allow access to data? Typically, researchers access data in two ways, direct access to the confidential data or public statistics and data. However, direct access is difficult due to clearance or eligibility issues, such as being a US citizen. Public statistics and data aren’t much better either. Awareness of the growing threats to public use microdata and a general concern for protecting participants’ data privacy have led the IRS to progressively restrict and distort more information being released in their public statistics and data, making the information less useful for academic research and policy analysis.</p>
<p>With our data science tools, we are improving the quality of the public data and creating a new tier in-between these two extremes.</p>

<p>However, sometimes our alterations to the data can be too much. For example, many people would say the resulting painting would not be a Seurat painting! Or you smoothed out the high income individuals that I wanted to analyze!</p>

<li><em>Insert explainer on how these privacy protecting tools works with the art example again for the validation server.</em></li>

<p>We expect our tools to become critical components of the federal, state, and local data infrastructure.

We are also engaging with Congressional Budget Office, Environmental Protection Agency, Joint Committee on Taxation, Duke University, and American Enterprise Institute to name a few.</p>

<p>If you are more junior, there is a concept called managing up. It involves taking initiative and seeking confirmation from those in charge. For example, “I think it would be a good idea to reach out to X to fund our project. Do you think Y would be a good approach, or do you have other thoughts?” Doing this enough will show your initiative and leadership (assuming you have good managers).</p>

<p>There are several ways to ask for feedback, including formal check-ins with peers or supervisors and performance evaluations. Beyond these, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proactively ask for feedback.</strong> When was the last time you did so? How often do you do it?</li>
<li><strong>Show what you do with feedback.</strong> Communicating that you’ve heard someone, confirming you understood correctly, and setting an action plan shows that their time spent giving feedback was worthwhile.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for feedback in alternative ways.</strong> Instead of “What can I do better?” ask, “What’s one concrete way I can improve in X?” Give them time to think about this question or use an anonymous form.</li>
<li><strong>Give yourself feedback.</strong> Set a regular reminder to reflect on successes, failures, things that are working well, and things that are not.</li>
<li><strong>Establish feedback loops.</strong> Consistently doing the previous steps will build positive momentum and make getting feedback easier over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>When receiving feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen without interrupting or defending.</li>
<li>Ask questions and request examples to gain a better understanding of the feedback.</li>
<li>Confirm your understanding by restating what you heard.</li>
<li>Slow down.</li>
<li>Take time to breathe.</li>
<li>Allow for pauses.</li>
<li>Thank the person for giving feedback, regardless of what it was.</li>
</ul>
<p>When giving feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set an intention for how you’ll approach the conversation.</li>
<li>Define the desired outcome of the conversation.</li>
<li>Use your own language.</li>
<li>Practice ahead of time.</li>
<li>Slow down.</li>
<li>Take time to breathe.</li>
<li>Allow for pauses.</li>
<li>Don’t personalize the feedback; use SIA (Situation, Impact, Action).</li>
</ul>
<p>When conducting a project, plan a time to reflect either at major milestones or at the project’s conclusion. There are always lessons to learn. Consider these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What were some successes of the project?</li>
<li>What could have gone better?</li>
<li>How effective was our internal team communication?</li>
</ul>

<p>As a first step, have a specific goal in mind when attending a networking event. Simply stating, “The goal is to network,” isn’t narrow enough. Are you hoping to make more contacts within a certain industry? Build better relationships with people at an agency? Identify potential funders for a project? Having a clear goal will guide your interactions.</p>
<p>Be ready with your elevator pitch. Yes, it’s cliché, but knowing how to introduce yourself is important. Have 3-second, 10-second, and 30-second versions ready because you never know how much time you’ll have.</p>
<p>For example, here are mine:</p>

Figure&nbsp;56: When you finally muster the courage to raise a difficult topic.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If the feedback or topic you want to raise is sensitive or difficult, follow the (Situation, Behavior, Impact) + (Question, Recommendation) model.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Situation:</strong> Describe the situation where the observed behavior happened. The more specific and object you can be about where and when, the better.
<ul>
<li>Effective Feedback is being specific and timely.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Use objective observations to describe the behavior for which you are providing feedback. Avoid using assumptions, character judgements, personality traits, or generalizations.
<ul>
<li>Effective Feedback is appropriate and objective.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Describe the impact the cited behavior had on the project, team, or individual performance.
<ul>
<li>Effective Feedback is positively intended and nonjudgmental.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Question:</strong> Offer the receiver the opportunity to engage in their own development by asking open-ended questions that encourage reflection and collaboration
<ul>
<li>Effective Feedback is collaborative and forward-focused.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Discuss what the receiver can do to best apply the feedback in the future to achieve the desired results. Remember to factor in their own input from the previous step when making your recommendations.
<ul>
<li>Effective Feedback is collaborative and forward-focused.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this framework, make sure to choose an appropriate time and place for the conversation.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-can-you-properly-disagree">How can you properly disagree?</h3>
<p>It’s okay to disagree, but disregarding someone’s viewpoint entirely can be upsetting. Start by acknowledging their perspective and explaining why you understand that stance. Then, calmly state your disagreement, using non-confrontational language. Provide reasons and evidence to support your viewpoint, suggest a middle ground, and ask for their input. For example, you might say, “I understand why you want to take X approach, but, given the current constraints, we need to consider a modified approach, such as Y. What are your thoughts on this?”</p>
<p>When you start by acknowledging their perspective before disagreeing.</p>

<p>It is generally safer to use formal titles unless told otherwise.</p>
<p>Also, women are often referred to as Ms.&nbsp;or Mrs.&nbsp;instead of their formal titles more frequently than men. To avoid irritation, use formal titles when addressing women initially.</p>
<p>For example, while I prefer to be called Claire, I dislike being called Miss Bowen, as I have never been Miss Bowen (married name). In an academic setting, if you’re unsure whether the instructor has a PhD, use Professor.</p>
