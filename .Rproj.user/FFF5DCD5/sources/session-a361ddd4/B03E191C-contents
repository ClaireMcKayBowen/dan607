Upon completion of a project, members of the team should consider the physical destruction of all copies of identifiable materials as required by contract (e.g., data use agreement), or, after three years, removal of all identifiers from data and separate maintenance of a name-code index in a secure location.

Acceptable methods for the disposal fall into two categories: logical and physical.

Logical destruction is generally done by erasing the data with multiple passes of read/write commands, such as by PGP File Shredder or deleting the content of a file systemâ€™s recycle bin.

Physical disposal generally means destroying the data media: shredding paper and CD/DVDs, degaussing magnetic media, or drilling holes through hard drives.
