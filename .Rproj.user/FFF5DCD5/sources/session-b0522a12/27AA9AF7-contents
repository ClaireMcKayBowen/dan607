For this week's discussions on non-technical professional skills, we will review and answer questions focused about being on the job market and time management.

::: {.callout-important}
## These are my very opinionated answers/advice.

Please note that what I am suggesting will not work for everyone and is based on my experience and some others. I hope they provide some guidance or suggestions to potentially explore. I often advise students and junior staff that it is best to get advice from several people. You will find a common thread among the people that will resonate with you, and you should go with that as a starting point.

## On the job market

### How do you explore new job opportunities...

**while being respectful of your current employer and avoiding the "grass is greener" syndrome?**

We will break down the answer to this question in four parts.

1. **Keep your materials up-to-date:**  Start by updating your resume, LinkedIn profile, and other professional materials. Personally, I update my CV/resume about every month, typically during the first week. In my field, it's common to have an updated CV for grant and contract applications. If you regularly maintain your resume or professional social media presence, it won't raise suspicions with your employer.

2. **Think about why you are seeking another opportunity:** Reflect on the key reasons for wanting to leave your current position. Is it a temporary annoyance, or is it a systemic issue that, if unresolved, will continue to affect your happiness?

   For example, one of the most common reasons for leaving a job is having a difficult supervisor. Even if you enjoy your work, colleagues, and company, a bad supervisor can be a compelling reason to leave. Supervisors play a crucial role in advocating for key changes on your behalf, finding professional opportunities, and advancing your career. They are often responsible for your raises and promotions. Without a supportive supervisor, your career may stagnate or become difficult to advance.

3. **Schedule interviews outside of work hours:** When scheduling interviews, try to arrange them outside of your work hours. It is unethical to use work time for interviews. Some people take time off, make up the hours later in the day, or schedule interviews outside of their regular work hours.

4. **Wrap up your projects neatly:** As a supervisor who oversees several people, my biggest request before someone leaves is that they wrap up their projects and responsibilities neatly. This means leaving clear instructions, passing on knowledge, and identifying someone who can serve as a backup until a new person is hired. Additionally, take on quick tasks that can be completed before your departure to help your colleagues with bigger projects.

   For example, one of my team members who helped managed my largest projects was leaving for graduate school. I had already identified a new person to take over her responsibilities. I asked the departing employee to train the new person, clean up the project directory, create read-me files or instructions for each subdirectory/responsibility, and meet with the new person to walk through those materials and responsibilities.

## Unpopular opinion: Proceed with caution!

I once received advice to apply for a job occasionally (e.g., once a year) even if you are happy with your current position. Applying for new positions informs you about how competitive your skills are in the job market (i.e., what you are worth). You may learn something new about yourself or what you value. You may also discover an even better opportunity than you currently have.

### What are the key elements of a good cover letter?

![First World Problems meme that says, "They want a cover letter. Now I can't apply for the job."](www/images/first-world-problems.jpg){#fig-first-world-problems fig-align="center"}

It goes without saying that most people (myself included) do not like writing cover letters. However, a good cover letter is important and should be customized to the job, highlighting how your experiences align with the job description. A cover letter typically has the following structure:

  - **Formal greeting:** The greeting is usually to the hiring manager to the hiring committee (if known). If unknown, you can use something generic like "Dear Hiring Manager."

  > Dear [Hiring Managerâ€™s Name or Group],
  
  - **Introduction:** The first paragraph or few sentences should state the position you are applying for, mention how you found out about the job opening (this is nice to know as the hiring manager), and provide a brief statement about why you are interested in the position or the company.
  
  > I am excited to apply for the position of [Position Name] at [Company Name] that was posted on [Where You Found the Job Posting]. With my background in [Your Field or Industry] and experience in [Relevant Experience], I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.
  
  - Or you could have the following for the last sentence.
  
  > Please accept this letter and my resume as my application for the position.
  
  - **Body Paragraphs:** The next two or three paragraphs should highlight your most recent and relevant experiences and how they match the job posting. Be specific! Simply stating that you are "organized" or "a good communicator" does not demonstrate this to the hiring manager. Provide specific examples from your experience to illustrate these qualities.
  
  > I feel that my qualifications are well matched to the posted job description and requirements. I am seeking an opportunity to challenge and build upon my knowledge and experiences. At present, I am [Role, Responsibilities, Skills, etc.]. This experience has equipped me with the skills necessary to [Relevant Experience].
  
  - Usually in second to last paragraph, you want to say why you are good fit for the company and why you are interested in that company.
  
  > My experiences, skills, and drive have prepared me to be an invaluable contributor to the [Company]. Moreover, being a part of [Company] would be ideal for my career as it would [Your Professional Goal and Alignment with Company Values/Mission].
  
  - **Closing paragraph:** This paragraph should reiterate your interest in the position, mention how to find more information (if not already stated at the beginning), explain how they can contact you for next steps, and thank the hiring manager for considering your application.
  
  > I am eager in taking the next step in this process, please feel free to contact me by phone or email. I appreciate you taking the time to review my application, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
  
  - Another example.
  
  > I am excited to bring my skills and experience to [Company]. I have attached my resume for your review and would love the opportunity to discuss further how my background, skills, and certifications will contribute to your team. Thank you for considering my application.

## Heavily edit AI cover letters! 

If you're going to use AI like ChatGPT to write your cover letter, make sure to heavily edit it afterward. **AI is a tool, not a crutch.** I'm currently reviewing job applications, and I can easily tell which ones were created with AI. The bonus for me is knowing which applicants to ignore.

This isn't to say you shouldn't use AI. HR and other companies are obviously using AI to filter applicants, so why not use the tool to help you? However, as I said, don't just generate the cover letter without editing it to add your own voice. One of the applicants my colleague and I invited for a phone screen stood out mostly due to her cover letter being so unique and thoughtful.

### What are some tips for interviewing well?

![Dwight Schrute meme that says, "Am I ready for this interview? False. Is this interview ready for me?"](www/images/interview-office.jpg){#fig-interview fig-align="center"}

Here are some general tips:

  - **Research your interviewers (if you know who they are).** They will likely look you up, so it's only fair you do the same. One candidate impressed me by reading a couple of my papers and sharing his thoughts during the interview.

  - **Prepare an introduction about yourself** that is concise, with a longer version ready if asked to elaborate.

  - **Research the company** and be ready to explain why you're applying for the role and why you want to work for the company.

  - **Dress appropriately and arrive on time** if the interview is in person. For virtual interviews, ensure good sound quality, a suitable background, proper lighting, and a functioning camera. First impressions matter, even on video calls.

## Practice your handshake

If you feel your handshake isn't strong, consider practicing it with family, friends, or anyone willing to provide honest feedback. I understand it can be challenging for men, as they may worry about exerting too much pressure on women's hands. However, women have the advantage in this regard, as we are less likely to apply excessive force. So, don't hesitate to give a firm handshake!

:::

  - **Take your time if needed.** It's okay to say, "Can I have a moment to think about this question?" before answering. It's better to gather your thoughts than to give a rushed or repetitive answer. Interviewers appreciate clear and concise responses.

  - **Speak clearly and confidently.** If the interview is on video or in person, try to smile and show enthusiasm, even if you're nervous. Some roles require strong public speaking skills.

  - **Prepare your own questions for the interviewer.** Remember, you're also interviewing them!

  - **Follow up with a thank-you note** reiterating your interest in the position.

## Take notes on how your interviewers responded to your questions

When I was on the job market after graduate school, I had a set of questions I loved asking interviewers. I would note their responses so that I could mention them in my follow-up thank-you email. I found that many of them would respond and comment on my email.

### How to negotiate salaries?

Before delving into salary negotiations, it's essential to research the typical salary range for the specific role and responsibilities, taking into account the geographical location. Professional societies such as the [American Statistical Association conduct surveys among their members](https://www.amstat.org/your-career/salary-information), gathering valuable salary data. Additionally, consider reaching out to friends and family occupying similar positions, if they're willing to share their salary information. While discussing salaries is often considered taboo, breaking this silence can be empowering for employees, rather than solely benefiting employers.

Many employers are obligated to disclose salary ranges, although some ranges may not be ideal (e.g., very wide). As a hiring manager, understanding your salary expectations is crucial, as it enables me to gauge whether my company can offer a suitable salary within that range (bearing in mind that I have limited control over the predetermined salary bands). This ensures that neither your time nor mine is wasted, minimizing frustration for both parties involved.

When presented with a salary offer, whether verbally or written, it's advisable not to immediately accept or reject it. If the offer is verbal, take a moment before responding, expressing gratitude for the offer without revealing your opinion on its adequacy. You should mull over the offer for at least a day, carefully considering the other benefits such as vacation time and healthcare provisions in addition to the compensation.

## Workplace organization

### What are effective ways to stay organized?

Understanding what drives you or what triggers your need for organization is key. For instance, I thrive on maintaining an "inbox zero" approach. To align with this, I create subfolders within my inbox to categorize emails related to projects, administrative tasks, and more. Each email must be addressed and filed in the appropriate folder before I can clear it from my main inbox.

![The first level of my inbox organization](www/images/claires-inbox.png){#fig-claires-inbox fig-align="center"}

Another strategy I employ is keeping essential information visible. I use my whiteboard to track my professional travel schedule, paper reviews, and the progress of paper publications. This whiteboard also helps me see if I've been overcommitting on these areas.

For day-to-day tasks, I rely on a notebook. At the start of each day, I list the top 2 to 4 priorities I aim to accomplish. Alongside, I maintain a to-do list, tackling tasks based on their importance and urgency. Breaking down larger projects into smaller, manageable steps also helps maintain clarity and progress.

### How can you avoid forgetting deadlines?

To ensure I never miss deadlines, I maintain a secondary calendar dedicated solely to reminders. This calendar prompts me to complete tasks and also reminds others of their responsibilities. I strongly recommend implementing a similar system. Examples of reminders I set include "set agenda for W meeting," "create announcement for X," "send email reminder for Y," and "send follow-up if Z doesn't respond."
