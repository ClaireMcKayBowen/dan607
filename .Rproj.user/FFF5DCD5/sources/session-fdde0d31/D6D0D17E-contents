## Complete course evaluations

The graduate programs asked that professors reserve time at the start of class for students to fill out their course evaluations. I will give everyone 10 minutes (5 minute check-in) to fill out the course evaluation.

## Final presentations

The goal of this final is to develop and deliver a clear, concise, and engaging presentation on a topic of your choice within a strict 5-minute time limit, but your target audience will be randomized. This exercise will help you improve your research, organization, and public speaking skills.

The presentation topic can be anything you learned in this course. It can be on something you wrote, in class discussion, contents in the book or other materials you read/watched, as long as it relates back to security, privacy, ethics, and equity.

### Vote for your favorite presentation

Each year, I ask students to vote for their favorite presentation. The person with the most votes will receive a gift card to a local cafÃ© or restaurant of their choice (or whatever business as long as is locally owned), paid for by me. You cannot vote for yourself.

After all the presentations are complete, please submit your vote [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsR0lviTF8b1UCjUctHiAQJWCMYZ8drW-33kpoRI89Yj7T-w/viewform?usp=sf_link).
