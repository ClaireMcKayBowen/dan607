For part 2, we focus on the importance of your target audience, different types of dissemination, and data visualization.

## Types of dissemination

Many of the following materials come from @schwabish2020elevate and @schwabish2021better.

![The "Complexity Pyramid" from @schwabish2020elevate.](www/images/elevate-pyramid.png){#fig-aspirational fig-align="center" width=100%}

> Every product on the Complexity pyramid links to one below it, grounded in in-deph, sophisticated analysis. Every blog post links to underlying evidence and a report. Every web feature includes the option to download a dataset or report. Every tweet finds its way back to a more in-depth analysis that provides evidence to support the claim made at each level of the pyramid. The data are available for the user who wants to dig deeper. Evidence is a as deep -- or deeper -- than the question planted, and then answered in detail.

To help create an audience list, check out this "[Audience \& List Brainstorming](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2019/11/18/elevate_the_debate_audience_list_brainstorming.pdf)" worksheet.

## Key takeaways for considering your audience

- **Identify your audience.** The most effective outreach campaigns are deliberate about who they are trying to reach and how they will reach them.
- **Narrow your focus.** Trying to reach everyone often results in reaching no one. It's better to find a smaller group of people who are keenly interested in your work than a wider group that may gloss over it.
- **Play the long game.** Building a relationship with your audience happens over time. Take hte time to undertand where your audience members are in their engagement and influence, and build from there.
- **Meet your audience where they are.** Build your trust and credibility by finding what is relevant to them and givng them the level of detail (or lack of detail) they need.

### Infographics

Infographics can be effective as a data dissemination product by:

- Using colors, graphics, and creative designs to make the content more engaging compared to plain text.
- Distilling complex information into digestible visuals, making it easier to understand and remember.
- Enhancing retention of the information, which results in quickly communicating the necessary information.
- Sharing the material is much easier for on social media and other digital platforms, such as blogs and websites.

### Blogs

A blog is more accessible to convey content to a wider audience than a long report. But, making a good blog is difficult!

When coming up with a concept, consider:

- **Sharing your unique perspective.** What are you offering to the topic that no one else can? 
- **Surprise your readers.** what would make people be surprised to learn about the topic? What surprised you about the topic?
- **Highlight next steps.** What would you want to explore further on the topic? Remember from our communication session? Always have a follow-up! 
- **Identify a hook.** What are you highlighting that sheds light on the topic?

When writing a blog, it should be:

- accessible and straightforward
- captivating from the first sentence
- focused on highlighting the main point early (to avoid losing your audience)
- free of jargon
- organized with bullets, multimedia, numbered lists, etc., to break up content
- linked to other resources for deeper dives into the content
- roughly 400 to 800 words in length
- composed of short paragraphs—four lines or fewer

Finally, the title and subtitles should be appealing, searchable, concise, and free of clichés.

## Key takeaways for blogging for Urban

- **Blogging expands your audience -- and your impact.** Blogging can be an effective way to get your research out into the world and into the hands of people who can turn your findings into action.
- **Keep your posts short and snappy.** Remember, one points per post -- more than one point means more than onepost -- and try to make it a quick read. Use links and multimedia as shortcuts.
- **Get the word out.** Use other communications tools at your disposal to drive readers to your posts.
- **Keep trying.** Learn from your missteps and celebrate your successes.

### Briefs and fact sheets

A fact sheet is a short document that contains the most relevant information about a specific subject. A fact sheet should be about a page or two in length with the goal to quickly and efficiently communicate the key facts and points in a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand manner. 

### Technical reports

Technical reports is a longer document that provide the full details of the process, results, and other information from a scientific study or research.

## Allegheny County social and human service utilization data

The Urban Institute collaborated with the Allegheny County Department of Human Services and the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC) to create [a synthetic version of the County’s confidential social and human service utilization data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/synthetic-integrated-services-data). Synthetic data replace actual records in a dataset with pseudo-records, with the goal of closely mimicking key distributional and statistical properties of the original records. This allows agencies to release data disaggregated by race and ethnicity while reducing the risk of privacy violations. Graduate students at the University of Pittsburgh examined the data and confirmed that it could be used effectively, for instance, to allocate resources for overdose prevention. WPRDC and other stakeholders plan to use the synthetic data to better understand and address racial disparities in the county, track changing patterns of service delivery, and develop more cost effective strategies for helping individuals who use multiple county services.

This pilot project produced a suite of resources we are using to support similar efforts across the country.

### Training materials

This [training series](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/allegheny-county-synthetic-data-trainings/) is provided in partnership with Allegheny County and the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC). While synthetic data has been used at the federal level, local governments and organizations often do not have the human or computational resources required to implement synthetic data as a privacy-preserving technique. As part of a pilot program intended to understand and target the specific privacy-related needs of local governments, the Urban Institute is offering these trainings to any local stakeholders wishing to learn more about creation, applications, and limitations of synthetic data.

### User guide and infographic

!["Why synthetic data works for Allegheny County" infographic.](www/images/synthetic-infographic.png){#fig-aspirational fig-align="center" width=100%}

This [user guide and infographic](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/synthetic-data-user-guide-and-infographic) accompanies a fully synthetic version of the 2021 Integrated Services dataset, which replaces the underlying records tracking the use of these services with statistically representative pseudo-records. Each record in the synthetic dataset represents a simulated individual, or record, who received at least one service from the Allegheny County DHS in 2021. The synthetic data were designed such that records aggregated by service represent the original data.

### Blog and technical material

- "[How Local Governments Can Harness Disaggregated Data without Compromising Privacy ](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/how-local-governments-can-harness-disaggregated-data-without-compromising-privacy)", Urban Wire blog, meant for a broader audience.

- "[Communicating Synthetic Data Evaluation Results with a Parameterized R Markdown Report](https://urban-institute.medium.com/communicating-synthetic-data-evaluation-results-with-a-parameterized-r-markdown-report-8367dd976ee3)", Data\@Urban blog (more technical).

### Fact sheet

Researchers, service providers, and other stakeholders can benefit from access to individual-level data safeguarded by governments or organizations. However, the public release of granular (disaggregated) data can violate the privacy of the people represented in that data. An alternative is to use synthetic data, which replace actual records in a confidential dataset with statistically representative pseudo-records, enabling data curators to release data that would otherwise be too sensitive for public release. This [fact sheet](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/understanding-synthetic-data) provides an overview of use cases for synthetic data and the broad process for creating synthetic datasets, including definitions of applicable terminology. It also discusses how to evaluate the quality and privacy of synthetic output.

### Technical report

This [technical brief](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/generating-fully-synthetic-human-services-dataset) details the methodology used and technical decisions my colleagues made when creating and evaluating the synthetic service data, including:

- background on data privacy importance and key definitions,
- limitations of current Allegheny County Human Services data products and use cases for synthetic data,
- key features of the service data and the resulting impact on our methodology,
- preprocessing the service data to serve as a valid input for the synthetic data generation process,
- modeling and synthesizing service usage and service distributions over time,
- postprocessing the synthetic output to match the desired use case, and
- evaluating candidate synthetic datasets for quality and privacy.

## Recommendations when publishing information based on confidential data

### Report only necessary information

In other words, do not share additional information, such as dates and locations, if it doesn’t contribute to the dissemination product.

### Avoid reporting inclusion and exclusion criteria for subpopulation analyses

Don’t discuss these criteria in a way that inadvertently identifies small cells or extreme cases (e.g., suppressed values with less than three that occurred in a census block).

### If possible, have participants review the products

If the dissemination product contains potentially identifiable information, such as direct quotes, the involved participant should be consulted before the product is released. Even if prior consent was given for the use of direct quotes, project team members should reach out to the individual to confirm permission for publication and attribution of the quote.

### Follow Transparency Initiative requirements

The [American Association for Public Opinion Research Transparency Initiative](https://aapor.org/standards-and-ethics/transparency-initiative/) provides a list of elements that must be disclosed with all publicly and/or proprietary research products. Most dissemination products should cover these basic requirements.

## Data visualizations

Similar to outlining a presentation, don't race to the computer. Start with paper and pen (or color pencils/markers!), chalkboard and chalk, etc. to sketch out your data visualization.

## Key takeaways for considering your audience

- Always consider your audience. Visualizations for an academic journal article will be very different than those you show to a policymaker or a reporter.
- Drive your reader's attention where you want it by carefully and purposefully using colors, lines, markings, and other visuals elements.
- Make your charts active through good, concise titles, and useful annotations.
- Don't get bogged down by the same old graphs time and time again; lots of different graph types out there might help reveal interesting patterns or insights in your data.

:::

### Show the data

### Reduce the clutter

### Integrate the graphics and text

### Avoid speghetti chart

### Start with gray

### Examples

- [What's Going on in This Graph?](https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph) - "Graphs, maps and charts from The Times — and an invitation to students to discuss them live." This feature is also in partnership with the American Statistical Association to [help educate grades 7 - 12+ students in math, science, English, and social studies](https://www.amstat.org/whats-going-on-in-this-graph) answer the following questions:

  - What do you notice?

  - What impact does this have on you and your community?
  - What is a catchy headline that captures “what’s going on this graph”?
  
- [PolicyViz Data Visualization Catalog](https://policyviz.com/resources/policyviz-data-visualization-catalog/) - From my colleague, Jon Schwabish, who "... built a collection of nearly 2,000 visuals to use as inspiration for [his] own work, and also to use as teaching materials to illustrate both good and bad practices. These real examples are helpful in a variety of ways: to demonstrate the wide variety of graphic types; to show variations in typography, color, tool, platform, and design; and to discuss how to implement perceptual rules to draw and direct attention."

- [Data Visualisation Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/) - A project developed by [Severino Ribecca](http://severinoribecca.one/) to create a (non-code-based) library of different information visualisation types. The website serves as a learning and inspiration resource for those working with data visualisation.
