## Quick recap

![Key stakeholders in the security and privacy ecosystem](www/images/stakeholders.png){#fig-stakeholders fig-align="center"}

We should think about the interactions of this ecosystem the data life cycle in the context of security, privacy, ethics, and equity.

## Data types
There are generally three principal types of qualitative and quantitative data:

1.	*Primary:* Any data directly collected by an entity. 

2.	*Secondary:* Any data collected by another organization that a stakeholder uses for analysis.

3.	*Administrative:* Any data collected by governments or other organizations, as part of their management and operation of a program or service, that provide information on registrations, transactions, and other regular tasks.

### Primary data
Direct data collection includes both quantitative data (e.g., from a survey) and qualitative data (e.g., from focus groups, site visits, qualitative interviews, or trained observations) collected from individuals or organizations.

### Secondary data
Secondary data also include both quantitative and qualitative data; depending on the source, they may also include some paradata.[^paradata] Often, secondary data are in public-use files that have been sanitized for general release and use. 

[^paradata]: Paradata are a by-product of data collection. Types of paradata vary from contact attempt history records for interviewer-assisted operations, to form tracing using tracking numbers in mail surveys, to keystroke or mouse-click history for internet self-response surveys. Because paradata are a by-product of a given data collection operation, their format, layout, and content are a function of the system that generated the data.

### Administrative data
Administrative data records are usually not public-use data files and tend to only be accessed through strict confidentiality agreements, such as non-disclosure agreements or memorandum of understanding.

### Read

- Chapter 3: How Do Data Privacy Methods Expand Access to Data?

### Optional additional read

[Do No Harm Guide: Applying Equity Awareness in Data Privacy Methods](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/do-no-harm-guide-applying-equity-awareness-data-privacy-methods).

### Write (600 to 1200 words)

We learned that one way to define data equity in the context of privacy is to consider equal privacy loss or equal access for different subgroups. Answer the following questions:

- Do you agree that these are helpful ways to define equity in the context of privacy?
- Are there additional ways you would define equity in the context of privacy?
- Are there other equity considerations to take into account?
- What are the ethical implications of defining equity in the context of privacy in these ways?
